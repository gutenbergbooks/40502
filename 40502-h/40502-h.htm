<h2 class="left">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="st">THE FLIGHT OF PRINCE FLORIMEL</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">All</span> that is here set down happened in
a wonderful country where wonderful
things are always happening.</p>

<p>In a certain kingdom there was
a young prince named Florimel.</p>

<p>His father, the king, had lately
passed away, but, though Florimel
was his only son, and of age, he
had not succeeded to the throne
that by right of birth was his.</p>

<p>The reason was that his father
had a brother, a very cruel, crafty
duke, high in the councils of the state, who had designs upon
the throne himself. In a covetous frame of mind he had once
taken a photograph of the crown and ermine robe, and the intelligent
palace parrot had made a remark thereat:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,&rsquo;&rdquo; croaked the
bird.</p>

<p>It was a wise quotation, and yet it was not wise to make it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
for right after that something happened to the unlucky parrot.</p>

<p>The duke with his evil influence swayed the opinions of the
royal cabinet which made the laws. In his wicked old heart
he wished Florimel out of the way.</p>
</div>

<div class="i009">

<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>

<p>If Florimel had been like other princes one reads
about his people no doubt
would have
insisted upon
his occupying the throne. But the throne was of ordinary
size, so that he never could have occupied it. Like other
princes he was all that was fair and handsome, but he was very
small indeed. He was no larger than the average-sized boy
of twelve, and the people who should have proved his loyal
subjects were well-grown men and women. In their talks
among themselves they showed a shame that anyone so small
should rule them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockr250">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s no bigger than a Brownie!&rdquo;
was a remark they very often made. &ldquo;It
would look foolish to have such a mite for
a king.&rdquo; For they were well informed
about the Brownies, and knew how
they perched on fences, or hid adroitly
whenever danger threatened.</p>

<p>But they were guided by
appearances, as too often
people wrongly are, and they
failed to realize that sometimes
the best goods are
done up in the smallest packages,
and that even a mite may be mighty.</p>

<p>The fact that Florimel was so small had been a great grief
to his late parents who had never been able to understand it.
He had been a fine, healthy baby who had won the hearty approval
of his doctors and nurses.</p>

<p>His mother always had an uneasy fear that the godmother
who assisted at his christening might have been concerned in
his diminutive size, but the king invariably poo-poohed at her
suspicions. This godmother was an ex-fairy, but advancing
age had interfered with her work of magic. Her joints had
become stiff and cramped, and she had contracted rheumatism
from sleeping in damp, dewy flowers. She did not get around
in the lively fashion she used to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Would she have bestowed on
him the gift of second sight and at the same time taken away
his size? Depend upon it, my dear, her intentions were perfectly
straightforward and honorable.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;But it may have been this second sight has interfered with
his growth,&rdquo; said the queen. &ldquo;His vision is simply wonderful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was indeed so. Prince Florimel could see things no
one else could. Furthermore he could see them at night.
Some wise old soothsayer declared that he was gifted with supernatural
powers.</p>

<p>One other gift had his ex-fairy godmother presented to him,
a bow and quiver of arrows which she averred were priceless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I charge you,&rdquo; she said most impressively to the king, &ldquo;never
to let your dear son have the bow and arrows unless there comes
to him some moment of great danger. Then let him place one
of these arrows to
the bow, and shoot
it where he will.
The result will be
miraculous.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i011.png" width="300" height="217" alt="Gift" title="" />
</div>

<p>After she had
gone back to the
old-ex-fairy-ladies&rsquo;
home the
king was strongly
tempted to shoot
one of the arrows
from the bow just
to see what would happen. With great difficulty he repressed
his curiosity, and placed the bow and arrows in the family safe
whose combinations was known only to himself.</p>

<p>So time passed happily, and one year added its joys to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of others, until there came the sad day when Florimel lost his
dear mother. There was much sorrow throughout the entire
kingdom, for the queen was a gentle, gracious one whose
kind words and good deeds had endeared her to the hearts of
all. So great was her loss to the king that he did not survive
her long. Ere he joined her he called his brother, the duke,
to his bed, and said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are my only kin outside of Florimel, so to your keeping
I entrust him. He is such a little chap you must be very
careful of him. After I am gone he will be king, and I am
sure he will rule well and wisely. He is a true king at heart if
not of stature. Promise me to be his councilor and guide, and
to incline him ever to the side of mercy, charity, and goodness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The false duke promised with great earnestness, but all the
while he was thinking of many wicked things.</p>

<p>With Florimel removed he would ascend to the throne himself.
Yet so well did he hide his guilty feelings that his brother
had no suspicion of any perfidy or wrong-doing, and passed
away in the peace befitting the righteous king he was.</p>

<p>After the king&rsquo;s death the duke through one pretext or another
delayed the coronation of the new. He incited his
nephew to feats and deeds of great danger and daring with
the evil hope that some terrible accident would befall him. But
in all the risks and hazards that he took, and none was too
great, it almost seemed that Prince Florimel bore a charmed
life.</p>

<p>Like other young people he had his dreams, and saw much
that was unreal, but with all these there had come lasting impressions.</p>

<p>When the duke failed to accomplish his evil designs, he determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
upon even more desperate methods in his game.</p>

<p>The people were beginning to chafe at the delay in the coronation,
and were clamoring for a new ruler. So the cabinet met
to decide this most important matter, and the duke presided
over the council.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a most embarrassing situation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ordinarily
we would place the only son of our late king on the
throne without question and amid great rejoicing. But we
are confronted by a most perplexing question.
Prince Florimel is what might be termed a freak.
The point is,
could he represent
his kingdom
with the proper
dignity?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="block300">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&ldquo;Prince Florimel
may be a
freak as you
say,&rdquo; remarked
a member of
the cabinet,
&ldquo;but at the
same time I have
never seen a handsomer, manlier young fellow. His symmetry
is perfect, and he is all that is chivalrous and brave. He is the
stuff true kings are made of. The only thing against him is
his size.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That I fear is an objection which cannot be overcome,&rdquo;
said the wily duke. &ldquo;Can we, a race of big men and women,
be governed by a pygmy king&mdash;a hop-o&rsquo;-my-thumb? We would
be the laughing stock of other kingdoms. Think, when the
rulers of all these met, and ours came among them, of the
mortification we would feel that we did not have a full-grown
man to represent us. His insignificance would make this country
insignificant to others. Those who did not know us, and
judged us by him, would look upon us as a country of dwarfs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Florimel is the late king&rsquo;s son, and heir to the throne,&rdquo;
said another member of the cabinet. &ldquo;Who else could reign
in his stead?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I am the next of kin,&rdquo; said the duke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if it were not for Florimel you would be the logical
king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us postpone our deliberations until tomorrow, by which
time I think I can find a way out of the difficulty,&rdquo; said the
duke, with deadly meaning.</p>

<p>The members of the cabinet looked at each other, and the
meeting silently adjourned. It had been conducted with the
utmost secrecy, and no one else was present but an old factotum
named Gando who was there to lock the doors. And
Gando, who was passionately attached to Florimel, heard the
duke&rsquo;s word, and was very uneasy in his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that is why,&rdquo; the old man said to himself, &ldquo;the duke was
sharpening his knife on the grind-stone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the duke had retired to his apartment Gando tiptoed
noiselessly after him, and placed his feeble, dim eye close to the
key-hole of the door.</p>

<p>What he saw froze the blood in his veins, and caused the few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
white hairs on his head to stand stiffly up with his great fright.</p>

<p>The duke was seated at his window, and the moonlight played
and glittered on a long, slender knife that he held in his hand.</p>

<div class="i013">

<div class="blockr325">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockr300">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Old Gando&rsquo;s knees knocked together, and he fled the spot.
Of one thing he was very sure. Florimel without loss of time
should place himself far beyond the reach of his wicked uncle.
Each added moment increased the prince&rsquo;s danger. Soon escape
might be too late. Before he
went to warn the sleeping prince
he secured the bow and
quiver of arrows that
had been intrusted
to his
care by the late
king. He hastily
provided
himself with
a smock, loose
cap, and long
trousers of
coarse cloth
such as children
of poor
peasants wear.</p>

<p>With these in his trembling arms, breathless from his exertions
and the great excitement under which he labored, he
entered Florimel&rsquo;s bedchamber, and closed the door noiselessly
behind him. With his fair head resting on his curved arm,
Florimel slept. Gando gave a great sigh of relief when he
heard his gentle breathing. He flew to the bedside, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
straightway roused the slumbering prince from his dreams.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i014.png" width="442" height="534" alt="In bed" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, master, my dear young master!&rdquo; he cried with his voice
broken by sobs. &ldquo;Rouse yourself, I beg of you, and go hence!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Do not delay, or you may be too late. Your cruel uncle this
very moment is plotting your death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Florimel sprang up in bed, and tried to rub the sleep from
his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where shall I go, good Gando?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I know not,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;The further you go
the better. You must leave behind you the boundaries of the
kingdom. See, I have brought these peasant&rsquo;s clothes for you
to wear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I still have my prince&rsquo;s attire,&rdquo; said Florimel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will not serve,&rdquo; said Gando. &ldquo;If you donned it you
would be quickly recognized, and your uncle would gain knowledge
of you to your swift undoing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He assisted the bewildered Florimel to dress, swung across
his back the quiver of arrows, and handed him the bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was your godmother&rsquo;s gift,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it might aid
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, though Gando urged Florimel not to take the time, the
latter printed something on a card which he tacked upon the
outside of the door before they left the place.</p>

<p>As they fled toward a secret exit they heard down the corridor
the stealthy tread of feet.</p>

<p>The duke snarled like a wild beast as he read the lines:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="lower">FAREWELL, DEAR UNCLE! KEEP YOUR EDGED TOOL FOR
FATTED SWINE!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fly!&rdquo; old Gando cried, as he thrust Florimel out into the
lonely, starlit night. &ldquo;Oh, my dear young master, fly for your
life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a sad and sudden change indeed for the youth, from
the pleasant dreams of guardian Brownies surrounding his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
bed, to the uncertainty of an unknown way before, and the
certainty of a cruel enemy behind. Snow-capped mountain
peaks in the distance had a forbidding look and, as though in
league with his old uncle, seemed to extend to him but a cool
welcome. The wakeful and observing beasts of the wood and
wild saw in him a new character never before met in the open
country, and were shaken with wonder and agitation while
they watched the hastening little traveller striding along the
lonely road, his only burden the bow and supply of arrows.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<p class="st">TITANIA COMES TO REIGN<br />
OVER THE FAIRIES</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Now</span> in another part of the same
country there was a race of
fairies who never grew old and
always remained beautiful.</p>

<p>Their loveliness of face and
form was beyond all description.</p>

<p>Just try to think of the prettiest
young girl you ever saw.
Well, even the plainest of these
fairies were ever so much prettier.
That is to say, all were
very beautiful with one exception.
In her case the fairy charm was an utter failure.</p>


<p>She was little and old, with a queer, wrinkled face like a
dried-up crab-apple. But, because no one else looked like her,
she was firmly convinced she was the most beautiful of them
all. They wore clinging gowns made of the texture of roses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
lilies, and other flowers. She who wore fragrant rose-petals
called herself Rose, she who called herself Lily one of lilies, and
so on. There were Violet, Daffodil, Bluebell, Daisy, Jassamine,
Hyacinth, and ever so many others. You could
find the names of all the rest in a seed-catalogue&mdash;that is,
all but the little old wrinkled one who was known as Dame
Drusilda. The fairies had a republic. Because they were
all so very
much alike,
and equally
beautiful,
gifted, and
clever, it
would have
been an extremely
awkward
matter
to select a
queen from among them. If any one had been chosen, all the
others would have felt greatly slighted. Dame Drusilda believed
she should be the queen, simply because no one else looked
like her, but she was quite alone in her opinion.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i017.png" width="341" height="209" alt="Fairy on horse" title="" />
</div>

<p>They were very up-to-date, and they had a palace of great
magnificence that had every modern convenience, with sanitary
plumbing. There was a very gorgeous throne-room, wisely
arranged in the event that they might some day have a
queen, with a portcullis at the entrance that could be raised or
lowered at will. This, of course, was to keep out unwelcome
visitors.</p>

<p>The republic was most beautifully situated where a river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
joined the sea, and upon a cliff one day the fairies beheld a most
unusual sight. While they were smiling and nodding a greeting
to some lovely mermaids who were down among the rocks
combing their long tresses with the
aid of hand-mirrors, a golden shallop
heaped with flowers came drifting down
the placid stream. The fairies signalled
to the mermaids who, when their
attention was attracted to the shallop,
swam to it,
and guided
it to the
shore. As
it drew near
all grew very
much excited
when they
observed a
most exquisite
little creature
nestling
asleep
in the fragrant
bed
of flowers.
When the shallop grounded gently on the pebbly beach her
eyes opened, and she gazed up at them with the most enchanting
smile imaginable. &ldquo;I am Queen Titania,&rdquo; she announced,
as they bent over her, &ldquo;and I have come to reign
over you!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>With tender hands they raised her from her couch, and knelt
before her in silent adoration.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i019.png" width="389" height="223" alt="In the boat" title="" />
</div>

<p>Never before had they seen anyone so beautiful, as she stood
before them in her long trailing gown, with a gem-crusted
crown upon her brow, and in her hand a slender wand from
whose tip shone the scintillating rays of a diamond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; said queer little Dame Drusilda, &ldquo;we
are all your loyal subjects. Let us conduct you to the palace,
where affairs of state await you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amid great rejoicing they conducted Queen Titania to the
palace. Wee-winged Cupids bore her long train. The portcullis
was raised, and in triumph they entered.</p>

<p>The new queen was conducted with much pomp to the throne-room.
When she was placed upon the throne, two dogs, two
frogs, and an ostrich were brought before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have they done?&rdquo; asked Queen Titania.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i020.png" width="449" height="342" alt="On the beach" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; said the fairy named Hyacinth, &ldquo;these two
dogs were fighting, and one bit off a piece of the other&rsquo;s ear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which was the one who did it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, this one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bind him over to keep the peace!&rdquo; said Queen Titania
promptly.</p>

<p>The fairies all nodded their approval as the dogs were led
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; then spoke up one of the frogs, &ldquo;will you be
kind enough to listen to the complaint of one who has always
tried to conduct himself like a perfect gentleman? I am a confirmed
bachelor-frog. This young lady-frog is continually pestering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
me with her attentions. She keeps on proposing marriage,
although it is not leap-year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With frogs every year is leap-year,&rdquo; said Queen Titania.</p>

<p>The ostrich looked very guilty as a fairy named Eglantine
explained:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty, he deliberately swallowed a half-dozen of the
palace spoons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you do it?&rdquo; asked Queen Titania of the culprit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said shamefacedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do,&rdquo; said Queen Titania. &ldquo;You did it to stir up
things. Have you a sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve got a bird!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now you can go and spoon with her!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i021.png" width="278" height="224" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>All were quite delighted with the wisdom shown by their tiny
sovereign in dispensing
justice. But before
other important
matters could be disposed
of a fairy messenger
named Pink
with her petalled attire
all flecked with
dust dashed in great
excitement into the
throne-room. She had
ridden many leagues
upon a winged steed,
and in its terrific speed which was far greater than that of the
swiftest aeroplane it had used both wings and feet.</p>

<p>Pink ran toward the throne to impart the news that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
brought her in such hot haste, but the unexpected sight of Queen
Titania stilled the words upon her frightened lips, and caused
them to part instead with wonder and surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Queen Titania,&rdquo; hastily explained Dame Drusilda,
&ldquo;who henceforth is to reign over us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pink knelt low before Titania and kissed her royal robe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am the bearer of bad news.
Dragonfel the wicked enchanter across the sea has declared his
intention of making trouble for the fairies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you this?&rdquo; asked Queen Titania.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little bird,&rdquo; was Pink&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i022.png" width="333" height="252" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;This is very serious,&rdquo; said Queen Titania gravely, &ldquo;for
little birds never tell fibs.&rdquo; There was a clamor of dismayed,
excited voices,
but the queen
raised her
wand for silence,
and
continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though it
may only be an
idle threat, I
will still appeal
to Euphrosyne.
Should we ever
need her help
right gladly she
will give it.&rdquo; Her hearers all looked puzzled, and Dame Drusilda
made bold to ask: &ldquo;Who is Euphrosyne of whom you
speak?&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you not heard of her?&rdquo; Queen Titania asked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with much surprise. &ldquo;She is the Goddess of Mirth, who tries to
make the whole world happy&mdash;a most gigantic task. Come
with me, and I
will send her an invisible
summons.&rdquo;
With the Cupids
bearing her train
she passed with
the fairies out to
the palace courtyard
where fountains
played and
flowers bloomed.
There she raised
her wand, and told
them to look up.
And doing so they beheld a most marvelous sight&mdash;a radiant,
smiling-faced, gloriously beautiful young woman in classical
white robes, with her sandalled feet resting ever so lightly upon
one of the pearl-tinged clouds.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i023.png" width="306" height="236" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>Around her circled snowy doves, cooing, fluttering, and settling
on her head, bare shoulders and arms.</p>

<p>While Titania waved her wand, she suddenly gazed downward,
as though something by means of an electric current had
been transmitted to her through the air. She stroked a dove
that had found its way trustingly to her hand, and as the others
flew from her she herself seemed plumed for flight.</p>

<p>The fairies watched her with a suspense that was almost
painful, but to their great disappointment the passing clouds
blotted her from sight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>But even the fairies who all the time are witnessing the most
wonderful things were quite astounded when Euphrosyne in
what seemed to be the very next moment appeared with the
dove right in their very midst.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i024.png" width="394" height="411" alt="Warning" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;What is your wish?&rdquo; she said to Queen Titania.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, beautiful Euphrosyne,&rdquo; said the little queen, &ldquo;we are
much concerned over the wicked Dragonfel.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i025a.png" width="302" height="248" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The enchanter
across the sea?&rdquo;
said Euphrosyne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what about
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He threatens
harm to the fairies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not borrow
trouble,&rdquo; said Euphrosyne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes people
make foolish
threats, and when others heed them they have a good deal of
needless worry.&rdquo; All looked very much relieved, and Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Titania said: &ldquo;Your encouraging words comfort us greatly.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i025b.png" width="447" height="298" alt="Chasing a bird" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; advised Euphrosyne, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d always keep the
portcullis down, and be very careful about admitting strangers.
Don&rsquo;t let anyone in without a first-class reference. If Dragonfel
annoys you, let me know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; asked Queen Titania.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can send this magic dove to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked at her, but she was gone, and no one knew
whither. She seemed to have just melted away. Where her
hand had been there was a dove, and, as it started to flutter off,
with some difficulty they caught it.</p>

<p>Though she was very much encouraged by all Euphrosyne
had said, Queen Titania still thought it prudent to post on one
of the palace walls a warning placard so that those who ran
might read.</p>

<p>And, it proved a task that was sufficient to interest some of
the fairies the rest of the afternoon, and, by the time they got
through, they were able to make some show at hitting the nail
on the head.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i027.png" width="205" height="220" alt="O" title="O" />
</div>

<p class="st">FLORIMEL REACHES THE ENCHANTED<br />
COUNTRY</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">On</span> and on flew Prince Florimel
from the wicked uncle who
meant to do him harm.</p>

<p>The friendly stars shone down
to guide him on his way, but
just what that way was he did not
know. His only thought to put
the palace as far behind him as he
could, and at times he turned his
head to look back at its frowning,
shadowy walls that finally disappeared
from sight. Florimel gave a deep sigh of relief, but
did not relax his speed in the slightest.</p>

<p>The words of the faithful old Gando were strongly impressed
upon his mind, and he realized that the duke had designs
on his life. When it was discovered that he was missing,
a search would be made for him, and once in the power of the
duke it would go hard with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>So on he ran, and the few people whom he met paid little or
no heed to him, thinking perhaps that he was some frightened
peasant-child hastening to or from home upon some urgent
night-errand. And as he went, always further and further
away from the palace, the houses grew fewer and still fewer,
till finally he found himself out in the open country.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i028.png" width="323" height="249" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>The stars were paling out, and by this time Florimel was very
tired, so that
when he saw a
hay-stack in a
field he quickly
sought it,
and burrowing
from sight
down into the
sweet-smelling
mass was soon
asleep.</p>

<p>The sun was
up when he
awoke refreshed.
He heard the cooling trickle of a brook hard by, and drank
thirstily, and laved his face and hands. Some distance off upon
a dew-spangled hillside thin smoke curled lazily up from the
thatched roof of a farmer&rsquo;s cottage. Florimel who felt the
qualms of hunger drew nigh to it resolved to ask for food.</p>

<p>As he approached the cottage a dog stretched out in the doorway
to enjoy the first genial rays of the sun jumped up and
started to bark, but almost instantly his barks ceased, and he
wagged his tail instead with friendly violence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>A stout, middle-aged woman with a kerchief on her head
came to the open door and eyed him questioningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good mother,&rdquo; he said, with a winning smile, &ldquo;may I trespass
upon your hospitality? I would fain break my fast, and
this coin will pay my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Food have we a-plenty, and to spare,&rdquo; said the kind-hearted
woman, &ldquo;so that you are welcome to it. But who are you, and
whence came you? You do not speak like a peasant&rsquo;s
child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I have some knowledge of fair speech,&rdquo; said Florimel.
&ldquo;Yet do I count myself one of the people. And I fare from
the city in quest of adventure. See, I have brought this bow
and quiver of arrows with me!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i029.png" width="327" height="255" alt="Mermaids" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Then most
surely you will
find it,&rdquo; said
the dame, &ldquo;for
we live almost
on the edge of
the kingdom,
and beyond
that line of
deep woods
there is a
strange country
with adventure
enough, I
warrant you. But come with me, and sit you at the board.
My good man has gone to loose the sheep from the fold, and
will be back very soon.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>So Florimel followed his hostess into the plain kitchen, and
took his place at a bare wooden table while she busied herself
in the preparation of the meal. And, as he sat there, and she
was occupied with her task, there rose from outside a sudden
hub-bub, made up of the gallop of many horses&rsquo; hoofs, the clank
and rattle of swords and uniforms, and the jargon of excited
human voices.</p>

<p>The woman in great curiosity rushed from the oven to the
door, and Florimel jumped down from his chair, running after
her, and peering out from behind her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soldiers!&rdquo; she cried, astounded beyond measure. &ldquo;What
are they doing here, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i030.png" width="381" height="226" alt="LOOKING FOR BROWNIES" title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">LOOKING FOR BROWNIES</span>
</div>

<p>The farmer with cap in hand looked up at them, awed and
confused by their fine airs and magnificence, and while they
volleyed questions at him silently and stupidly shook his head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
until at last in their impatience and disgust they put spurs to
their horses&rsquo; flanks and galloped off in clouds of dust.</p>

<p>Then the good man ran toward the house, suddenly finding
voice, and shouting at his wife:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a great to do! The young Prince Florimel has
disappeared in the night, and the whole kingdom is
aroused!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then noticing Florimel for the first time he asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A chance guest to break his fast with us,&rdquo; said his wife.
&ldquo;But let us eat before the food grows cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Florimel partook heartily of the plain fare of the farmer
and his wife, and throughout the meal the talk of his hosts was
of the missing
prince.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i031.png" width="307" height="252" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Poor lad!&rdquo; said
the woman with a
sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that all
is well with him.
Yet much I fear
this search for him
is vain. His uncle,
the duke, could
tell, I warrant,
what has happened
to him. But he
will never be heard of more, and the wicked duke will now be
king.&rdquo; &ldquo;You who have come from the city,&rdquo; said the farmer
to Florimel, &ldquo;no doubt some time have seen the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
prince. What kind of a young lad was he? A likely one,
so I have heard.&rdquo; &ldquo;He had his faults,&rdquo; admitted Florimel.
&ldquo;He was very small of build&mdash;no taller than I. When last
I saw him he looked
not unlike me. I
doubt if he weighed a
penny weight more.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="i032">
<div class="block250">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block250">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block250">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block250">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall3">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&ldquo;Was he handsome?&rdquo; asked the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I handsome?&rdquo; asked Florimel in return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Candor compels me to tell you you are not,&rdquo; she frankly
said, &ldquo;though you are not ill-favored, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still if I wore the prince&rsquo;s attire,&rdquo; said Florimel, &ldquo;I would
be as handsome as he. But let us change the subject. You
spoke but a while ago of that strange country which lies adjacent
to this. In what manner is it strange?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But little is known of it,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;for, in truth, it
is a place to be avoided. There are few humans bold enough to
penetrate its mysteries, for in the forests and dense undergrowth
are savage beasts that wreak harm. Often we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
hear their wild cries at night, and our hearts are chilled. And,
even if one escape the beasts, there are Brownies and fairies to
weave their mystic charm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the Brownies there too?&rdquo; asked Florimel, with interest.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i033.png" width="381" height="342" alt="Beasts and Brownies" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, that they are!&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;But it is not the
Brownies that would hurt you. They are kind little creatures
who would help instead of harm you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to see them,&rdquo; said Florimel reflectively.
&ldquo;Many a night as I lay in my bed have I dreamed of the
Brownies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See them you cannot,&rdquo; said the woman decidedly, &ldquo;since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
you have not second sight. Many have tried to see the Brownies,
but they have failed through lack of supernatural vision.
But there are Brownies nevertheless, and they go everywhere.
Of that we have abundant proof, have we not, husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;Once when I lay flat upon my
back, and the grain in the field was in danger of rot, the Brownies
came one night and harvested it. In the morning it was all
cut and stacked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the good wife hastened to add, &ldquo;and that very same
night they churned the cream to butter.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="i034">
<div class="block275">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block275">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block275">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block275">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block275">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall3">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure the Brownies did it?&rdquo; asked Florimel, in
surprise. &ldquo;Who else but
the Brownies?&rdquo; said the
farmer positively. &ldquo;We had
set a bowl of cream for
that is all they ask, and next morning the cream was gone.
Wife, show him the bowl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman thereupon exhibited an empty blue delf bowl,
and Florimel was convinced. He rose with his hosts from
the table, and went to the doorway from which he gazed to the
far line of woods that now held such charm for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me pay you my faring, good people,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for I
would be on my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, there is naught you owe us,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;for you
have been a welcome guest. You are a fine young lad, and I
have a fancy for you. You had better bide here with us.
There is work for you to do for your board and lodging. I
need someone to tend the sheep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, my good man,&rdquo; said Florimel, &ldquo;but I must leave
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whither would you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To that strange country of which your good wife spoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say not so, young master,&rdquo; implored the woman earnestly.
&ldquo;There are wild beasts there waiting to devour you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there are wild beasts of men sometimes even more
terrible,&rdquo; said Florimel. &ldquo;I will take my chances with the
beasts. All that I have loved I have lost, so there is naught to
keep me. Each moment I tarry but adds to the danger that
encompasses me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master, can it be?&mdash;yes, it must be!&rdquo; cried the man, with a
great light breaking upon him. &ldquo;You are the prince!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am indeed he!&rdquo; said Florimel. &ldquo;Convey word to
my uncle that I am gone, and that the child of the brother who
trusted in him will never trouble him again. If the people
choose him for their ruler, let the consequences be on their own
heads. And now farewell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this last word on his lips he broke into a run. The man
with the best of intentions tried to follow in the hope of dissuading
him from his rash purpose, while his wife frantically
shouted for the young prince to come back.</p>
</div>

<div class="i035">

<p>But with the bow and arrows that might mean so much to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Florimel only increased his
pace, so that the other was
soon distanced. Finally the
man in despair gave up the
chase, and stood watching
until Florimel turned, waved
his hand, and disappeared
into the heavy growth of forest. And on
and on he went, though nothing extraordinary
befell him. So for three days he
continued, suffering neither from hunger nor from thirst, for
there were plenty of pure brooks at which he could lave and
drink, and it was the time of the delicious tomtom, a juicy fruit
everywhere in great abundance, which tasted like a banana
flavored with vanilla ice cream, and which had all the sustaining
qualities of beefsteak.</p>

<p>Of this Florimel partook heartily and at will, as well as of
berries and nuts, and when weary slept for precaution&rsquo;s sake in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the forked branches of trees, with his rest broken only by the
crashing of some skulking animal through thick, tangled underbrush
in quest of prey or a long, drawn-out, shuddering night-cry
that would chill his blood and cause his heart for a moment
to cease its beat.</p>

<p>Still there were trees growing thickly together, and retarding
and making difficult one&rsquo;s advance. But, just when he was
growing discouraged, they began to thin out, and he came into
more open spaces.</p>

<p>Finally he reached a tiny lake that shone like a turquoise in
a bowl-like formation at the base of a steep hill.</p>
</div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i036.png" width="272" height="243" alt="Eagle&lsquo;s nest" title="" />
</div>

<p>A path ran up the hillside, and this evidently had been much
in use, for the grass was worn and trodden by many feet. On a
ledge there was an old,
decaying, leafless tree,
and on one of its gaunt,
top-branches that jutted
over the lake a pair
of intrepid eagles had
built their nest. Florimel
looked up and spied
the young eaglets who
were just old enough
to essay flight, selfishly
trying to crowd each
other out of their airy
structure of sticks and
straws. Far overhead their parents described invisible circles
in the sky, emitting as they did so harsh shrieks of pride.</p>

<p>While he gazed upward, thinking meanwhile that it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
strange abode for eagles to choose, in place of the customary
mountain-crag, he was suddenly startled by the savage roar of
beasts.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash he turned, and saw a wild, fierce, snarling
pack&mdash;a confused, horrifying vision of lions, tigers, and leopards&mdash;their
red tongues lolling from their watering mouths&mdash;their
nostrils dilated at the scent of human blood&mdash;flying with
leaps and bounds to rend and tear him apart and devour him.</p>

<p>Desperately he seized an arrow from the quiver, and placing
it in the bow pointed it at them and pulled back the cord.</p>

<p>But the cord snapped in twain, and the arrow fell harmlessly
to the ground.</p>

<p class="st1">THE HUMAN OCTOPUS STARTS<br />
UPON A MISSION</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper1">Across</span> the minor sea whose blue, sparkling
waters kissed the fair shores
of Queen Titania&rsquo;s fairy kingdom,
about a hundred leagues as flies the
crow, there was another country
where lived the notorious enchanter
Dragonfel.</p>

<p>A fairy messenger on a winged
steed had conveyed information that Dragonfel intended to
make trouble. But this was nothing new for Dragonfel.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he was always trying to make trouble for
everybody. Trouble was his specialty.</p>

<p>Dragonfel was not a nice man, and, if you had known him,
you would not have liked him. He cheated when he played
croquet, and he was always claiming wickets that he never
made. He did not go to Sunday School, either. If he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
gone, he would not have put a penny in the plate for the heathen.
That was the kind of man he was.</p>

<p>Yet he was the possessor of fabulous riches, and he never
would have missed what he might have given away had he been
charitably inclined, which he was not in the least.</p>

<p>No one else in the whole world was as wealthy as he. He
owned a combination mine in which were diamonds, rubies,
sapphires, emeralds, and other precious gems galore, some of
them as big as cobblestones.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i039.png" width="344" height="220" alt="Burning Bank Bonds" title="" />
</div>

<p>It may be said with safety that Dragonfel was inclined to
have his own way, and carry out his own ideas. He was very
rich, and had money to burn. When in the mood of celebrating
some great event, such as the Burial of Good Intentions,
or the Failure in Eden, instead of climbing on some rock to
set off firecrackers, burn Roman candles, or discharge toy cannon,
he delighted in burning Bank Bonds, Legal Tenders, or
Government Securities of large denominations, until the ashes
of them were declared a nuisance by his Board of Health, and
with reluctance he would discontinue his celebration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>As is usual in all such great operations there were panics at
times, through alarms of fire, explosions, or escaping gas, when
everybody tried to get out at once and but few could escape.</p>

<p>One day it would be the danger of being smothered, the next
of being roasted, the third of a cave-in where all would be
buried alive, and so from hour to hour fear was in the way.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i040.png" width="357" height="291" alt="Distress in the mine" title="Distress in the MINE" />
</div>

<p>There were mine-sprites whom he kept steadily at work,
without regard for Union hours, digging the gems out with
their fingers.</p>

<p>The poor mine-sprites were greatly over-worked, and not the
least regard was paid to life or limb. The hours were long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
they struggled at the wheelbarrows or mine-carts, either pushing
or pulling, with their unreasonable loads piled high in the
air, and with gems that in the market would have brought
enough to pay the debt of a Principality slipping off, and rolling
in the dust.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i041.png" width="393" height="307" alt="Pulling" title="" />
</div>

<p>The palace of Dragonfel was a sight, and it would have made
your eyes blink to see it. It was constructed entirely of diamonds,
rubies, and emeralds all stuck together with cement.
There were no opals, because Dragonfel thought they were unlucky.
If you could have pried off any one of them you would
have had enough to keep you in the greatest luxury all your
life. The famous Kohinoor was but a grain of sand compared
to any of them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Back of the palace, and casting a frowning shadow over it,
was a single towering mountain whose top was an extinct volcano.
No one could recall the exact date of its last eruption,
for Dragonfel stubbornly insisted upon running his business
without an almanac. There were those scientifically inclined
who leaned to the theory that the volcano had been the cause of
all the gems in Dragonfel&rsquo;s mine.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i042.png" width="399" height="394" alt="Hammering" title="" />
</div>

<p>Though it must have been a very long time since the volcano
had celebrated with home-made fireworks, the enchanter had
always anticipated a further display, so he had taken the precaution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to buy an old-fashioned fire-engine which was installed
conveniently at hand in a building over whose doors was the
caption: <span class="lower">NEPTUNE HOOK AND LADDER CO. NO 1.</span> In the building
were plenty of rubber coats, boots, and red helmets. Everything
was ready for an emergency.</p>

<p>There were some who declared that Dragonfel had some
business connection with Beelzebub, but, whether this was true
or not, he had the bad taste to get himself up after the authentic
portraits of that disreputable person. He was very tall indeed,
with almost a scarlet countenance, and he wore a long, flowing
cloak that was a perfect match for his complexion. He kept
his hair rather long, and brushed it stiffly up, to convey the impression
that he had a natural horn.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i043.png" width="301" height="248" alt="Guard" title="" />
</div>

<p>He boasted a
host of followers,
all big, hulking
black-guards of
giant-like stature,
with repulsive
names such as
Boundingbore,
Mandrake, Wolfinger,
Grouthead,
Snoutpimple, and
the like, and whenever
they did something
mean he rewarded
them. The consequence was that they were trying to
do mean things all the time.</p>

<p>They were in charge of the mine, and the way they treated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
poor mine-sprites was awful. It was a good thing for them
that the officers of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children were unable to get around.</p>

<p>So on a certain day, following his usual custom, Dragonfel
was making an inspection of the mine. He had descended
through a secret passage, and walked about the dark chambers
lit here and there by gloomy flares of light.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i044.png" width="357" height="326" alt="Basket" title="" />
</div>

<p>Guarded by the enchanter&rsquo;s cruel followers, the mine-sprites,
poor little, emaciated, witch-like creatures in tattered clothes,
were digging away with their raw, bruised fingers at the sides
of earth and exhuming precious stones. They were not allowed
to use picks, for that would have made the work easy.</p>

<p>Diamonds, rubies, pearls, amethysts, emeralds, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
gems, every one of them worth a king&rsquo;s ransom, lay piled about
carelessly in heaps. The opals when they were discovered were
thrown away. Sprites kept staggering off with heavy loads in
wheelbarrows.</p>

<p>Dragonfel surveyed the work with great satisfaction, and
asked Grouthead who was in general charge:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When were they fed last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three days ago, kind master!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everyone called him &ldquo;kind master,&rdquo; though whether this was
in sarcasm or not no one knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See that they don&rsquo;t get anything to eat before the full week
is up,&rdquo; ordered Dragonfel. &ldquo;And that reminds me of my own
dinner. Boundingbore, tell the cook I want turtle soup, spiced
venison pastries, apple dumplings, strawberry shortcake, and
iced lemonade with plenty of crushed raspberries in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mouths of the poor little mine-sprites watered, and they
smacked their lips, but Grouthead snapped his long snake-whip
so that it sounded like a pistol-shot, and they frantically continued
digging away in the earth with their fingers.</p>

<p>Boundingbore flew to do Dragonfel&rsquo;s bidding, and Snoutpimple
observed, rather timidly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The air down here is very bad, kind master!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Dragonfel, with hearty unction. &ldquo;It
might make me ill if I were obliged to remain, so as I have a
proper regard for my health I think I will get right out into the
open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attended by Mandrake, Snoutpimple, Wolfinger, and some
of the rest, he went on his way, while Grouthead snapped his
whip to incite the frightened, gasping, exhausted mine-sprites
to further effort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<div class="i045">

<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall4">&nbsp;</div>

<p>When he came up out of the shaft Dragonfel gave a deep
breath of relief as his nostrils sucked
in the bracing air that had a salt tang
of the sea in it. Out in the harbor
there tossed a galleon on the lazy
swell&mdash;a craft built low amid-ship,
and with both bow and stern curving
high into the air.</p>

<p>Dragonfel gazed off at it with interest, and remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may come in handy soon if these Brownies and fairies
continue longer. They are getting altogether too good, and
must be stopped. But let us go back to the palace to see if anything
has happened in our absence.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing else was to be seen on the wide water to draw his attention,
except some mermaids who were above the waves, engaged
in combing their hair, who, to most people, are very interesting.</p>
</div>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i046.png" width="324" height="208" alt="Mermaids" title="" />
</div>

<p>A little bird with very acute hearing listened intently to his
words as it lightly balanced on the twig of a gumdrop tree, and
then flew straight across the sea to tell a fairy, who told the
other fairies. Dragonfel with his big, clumsy, lumbering cohorts
strode on to the palace that was guarded by a Demon
Usher&mdash;a queer,
comical-looking
chap who with
his wings much
resembled a human
grasshopper,
and who
half flew, half
walked.</p>

<p>He had thin
little wisps of
hair sticking out
from each side of his nose, like the scanty whiskers of a cat.</p>

<p>The Demon Usher with hops and jumps escorted him to a
magnificent throne, and grovelled with smirks before him, while
Dragonfel with what he thought to be the quintessence of grace
sank upon it, and then arranged himself in what he imagined
was a kingly posture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he gruffly said, &ldquo;has anyone been here since I&rsquo;ve been
gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, kind master!&rdquo; the Demon Usher hastened to assure him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
&ldquo;No one has been here since the band and you remember them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that band!&rdquo; repeated Dragonfel, with a shudder. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t get their notes out of my ears yet. But what have we
here?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="i047">
<div class="block275">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block275">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall4">&nbsp;</div>

<p>A huge creature resembling an octopus, with great, staring
eyes popping from his head, and hundreds of fuzzy tentacles
protruding in all directions from his grotesque body, came
crawling toward him. Straightway Dragonfel sprang up
from the throne, while
Wolfinger, Mandrake,
Boundingbore, and
Snoutpimple, who had
assumed respectful positions at
his sides, drew back in alarm.</p>

<p>But the Demon Usher gave a cackle of a laugh, and gleefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
rubbed his hands together as though he were washing them
with invisible soap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have no fear, kind master!&rdquo; said a thin, piping voice from
somewhere within the horrid creature&rsquo;s hulk. &ldquo;Is not this a
pretty disguise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Red Spirit, as I live!&rdquo; cried Dragonfel, in a tone of
admiration not unmixed with relief. &ldquo;You rascal, why have
you chosen this masquerade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But is it not a clever one?&rdquo; persisted the Red Spirit. &ldquo;See,
kind master, I can either compress or expand myself at will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke he shrank to practical insignificance, and then
almost immediately afterward swelled out until it seemed that
he would burst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; said Dragonfel encouragingly. &ldquo;You can be of
great assistance to me. I have a mean task for you to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The meaner the better, kind master!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dragonfel raised his arm, and pointed toward a window that
gave a vista of the far-off, smiling sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, Human Octopus,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;and spy upon the
Brownies and fairies!&rdquo; Without another word the hideous object
started to crawl off by means of his myriad tentacles, and all
who were present watched his convulsive, eccentric movements
with malicious satisfaction.</p>

<p class="st">PRINCE FLORIMEL MEETS<br />
THE BROWNIES</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Prince Florimel</span> gave a
great shudder of fright when
the gift of his ex-fairy godmother
so utterly failed him in
that moment of terrible danger. As
the savage beasts, screaming for his
blood, came toward him, he turned and
fled, without relaxing his hold upon the
treacherous bow. He made a frantic leap for the trunk of the
tree, and grasping one of the low branches pulled himself up
with desperate haste as far as he could.</p>

<p>The beasts with thunderous roars and sharp teeth showing
sprang up at him, and a lion with knife-like claws just grazed
the skin of one of his legs, and tore off a portion of his
garment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i050a.png" width="324" height="235" alt="Up a tree" title="" />
</div>

<div class="figright1">
<img src="images/i050b.png" width="326" height="257" alt="Fighting" title="" />
</div>

<p>Florimel climbed up further, and still further, for safety,
while the animals roaring their defeat continued to hurl themselves
at the
tree until it
shook and
shook again.</p>
</div>

<p>Finally they
took to fighting
among
themselves,
with outcries
that were terrible,
and finished
by slinking
or limping
away discomfited.</p>

<p>The eaglets
disturbed by
all this clamor
perched on
the edges of
their nest as
though deliberating
upon
the hazard of
trying for the
first time their
wings in the
dizzy space of blue. High overhead their angry parents soared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
screaming their protests at what seemed to them an unwarrantable
intrusion.</p>

<p>Still retaining the bow, Florimel climbed out toward the nest,
intending to usurp possession of it, and with timid flaps of their
untried wings the eaglets essayed flight. Finding they could
fly, they soon gained confidence, and joined the parent-birds
who led them a mad aerial chase.</p>

<p>Soon Florimel was the sole tenant of the nest, and, after he
had established himself comfortably in his new quarters, he set
about to repair the damage to the bow.</p>

<p>He tied the broken cord securely, and drew it taut, pulling
it back as far as he could repeatedly, but he did not waste in a
trial one of the remaining arrows in his quiver. For, though
it had already
brought to him
one grievous disappointment,
he
still had faith in
his ex-fairy godmother&rsquo;s
gift.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i051.png" width="308" height="252" alt="Resenting eagles" title="" />
</div>

<p>The eagles resenting
his possession
of their
home kept flying
threateningly at
him, but every
time they came
near he menaced them with the bow and drove them away.
Finally they alighted on another limb of the tree, where they
all sat in a row viewing him with silent moody protest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Worn by fatigue and excitement Florimel closed his eyes in
sleep, with an arm bared to the elbow hanging from the nest.
When at last he was awakened by a confused babel of voices
from below, dusk had fallen, and a crescent moon hung low in
the sky.</p>

<p>The eagles young and old in agitated manner once more were
circling the darkening sky, and leaning over the nest and looking
down Florimel was astounded by what he saw.</p>

<p>And no less astounded than he was were a band of little
people who had caught a glimpse of that rounded human arm
sticking from an eagles&rsquo; nest with consequent and complete
mystification to all.</p>

<p>In a ring and with characteristic postures they stood gabbling
among themselves and pointing up&mdash;a queer, very queer
race, all males, with round fat little pot-bellies, thin, spindling
shanks, long, tapering feet, and babyish-looking heads set on
their shoulders apparently without connecting necks. And
these heads had large ears, wide mouths, and pop eyes&mdash;a combination
that ordinarily would make the possessor of them
ugly, but which in their case contributed general results that
made them unusually winning and attractive.</p>

<p>As Florimel looked down he could note that there were many
of one type&mdash;tiny fellows who wore the same kinds of caps and
jackets. But there were others too&mdash;one of each kind&mdash;a Policeman
with a club, a Sailor with a spy-glass, an Indian, a Cowboy,
and a single representative from every country of importance
in the world. England, Ireland, Scotland, France, Germany,
Russia, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Turkey, Greece,
Spain, Portugal, China, Japan, the United States, Canada, and
other lands had their delegates whom Florimel could distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
by means of a strange human picture-book in the museum
of the kingdom from which he had flown, and which often he
had been permitted to see. And, while he marveled and wondered
thereat, his keen eye alighted on another too&mdash;a tiny chap
with high-topped, bell-crowned hat, black clothes with swallow-tail,
a wide expanse of spotless white shirt-bosom, spats, and
glistening patent-leather
shoes&mdash;a
pompous, vain,
conceited, immaculate-looking
little fellow who
carried a cane
that seemed a
part of him, and
who wore a round
piece of glass over
one of his eyes.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i052.png" width="303" height="236" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>In order to obtain
a better view Florimel leaned further over, and so disturbed
the architecture of the nest, from which the sticks began
to fall, until he felt the whole foundation going. But so suddenly
did this occur that he did not have a chance to grasp a
saving branch, and in a trice plunged through the bottomless
structure down&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;</p>

<p>He closed his dizzy frightened eyes, struck the waters of the
lake, then disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>The curious band watching him were quick to realize his predicament.
Without loss of time they ran to a shelf of rock that
over-hung the lake, and one and all jumped in after him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Ker-splash! ker-splash! resounded on all sides until the water
was dotted with
bobbing heads.</p>

<div class="i053">
<div class="block325">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block325">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block325">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block325">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall2">&nbsp;</div>

<p>As Florimel came
to the surface,
blinded and choking,
someone quickly
grasped him,
and, while the rest
formed a living
chain, he was passed on from
one to another, until the last
dragged him safely to shore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon they were all gathered about in a ring, with Florimel in
the centre, and, while the soft wind dried their dripping clothes,
they looked at him,
and he at them, with
wonder and surprise
on all their faces.</p>
</div>

<div class="i054">
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall3">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockr300">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockr300">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockr300">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockr300">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&ldquo;Avast there, messmates!&rdquo; said the Sailor to the rest.
&ldquo;What did I tell you? He can see us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the cry was taken up all around the ring:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can see us! He can see us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be able to see you?&rdquo; said Florimel, rather
impatiently. &ldquo;I have eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said one who wore a long black gown, and who had
a tasseled mortarboard on his head, &ldquo;but so have other people.
It takes second sight to see the Brownies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Brownies! Florimel&rsquo;s heart gave a sudden bound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much am I beholden to you all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for having rescued
me. If you had not saved me I should have been obliged
to save myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you swim?&rdquo; asked the Sailor, while all looked much
chagrined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like any duck!&rdquo; was Florimel&rsquo;s response. &ldquo;But are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
mortal?&rdquo; questioned the Uncle Sam Brownie. &ldquo;No mortal eye
has ever yet beheld us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My ex-fairy godmother at my christening bestowed on me
the gift of second sight,&rdquo; explained Florimel, &ldquo;so that I have
always been able to see things no one else could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that accounts for it,&rdquo; said the Irish Brownie, while the
faces of all the others showed that a great mystery had suddenly
been cleared away. &ldquo;You must have supernatural
powers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of that I am not sure,&rdquo; said Florimel, &ldquo;but of this much I
am, that right gladly would I be one of you, to work and toil
while weary households sleep, to delight in harmless pranks and
helpful deeds, and never be seen by mortal eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked at each other, evidently embarrassed by so bold a
hint, and the Brownie Dude voiced the thought that was in all
minds when he fervently remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish King Stanislaus were here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are not a Brownie!&rdquo; said the Chinaman to Florimel
in a most decided tone. &ldquo;How could you join the band?
You don&rsquo;t look like a Brownie. What have you ever done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I fear,&rdquo; confessed Florimel. &ldquo;It is not what I
have not done, but what I hope to do, that makes me so presumptuous
as to beg the honor to be one of you. And, if I
were fortunate enough to be taken in by you, I would ever strive
to be helpful, faithful, and true, like a Brownie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words, delivered with earnest, manly spirit, created
their impression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be you have supernatural powers, as the Irishman
remarked,&rdquo; said the Student Brownie doubtfully. &ldquo;Have you
ever tried to put them to a test?&rdquo; Prince Florimel sighed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>What could he do to gain the confidence and esteem of these
little people whom already he was beginning to love? How
could he make them all his friends?</p>

<p>In his doubt and uncertainty his eye strayed to the bow in
his hand. A sudden thought came to him. In this extremity
it might be of aid.</p>

<p>But it had failed him once&mdash;would it fail him again?</p>

<p>Without a word he took an arrow from the quiver and placed
it to the bow. The Brownies watched his every movement with
the keenest interest.</p>

<p>He gazed about seeking some difficult target at which to aim.
With their pop eyes the Brownies gazed where he did.</p>

<p>He saw the crescent moon hanging low in the deepening sky,
like a hunter&rsquo;s horn, and pointed the arrow at it.</p>

<p>He pulled back the cord with all his strength, and to his great
relief it held. The arrow whistled away in its swift flight, and
was lost in the violet atmosphere.</p>

<p>But almost the next moment a great cry of surprise went up
from all the Brownies. The arrow that Florimel had shot was
sticking through the moon!</p>

<p class="st">THE HUMAN OCTOPUS<br />
SNOOPS AROUND</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Watched</span> by the admiring eyes
of Dragonfel and his followers
the Human Octopus wriggled
and squirmed his way out of the
enchanter&rsquo;s palace. And, whether
he flew through the air, or
swam through the waters, to
Queen Titania&rsquo;s fairy kingdom,
using his tentacles as propellers, is a matter for conjecture.
But, at any rate, he got there with all tentacles. Whenever
his suspicions were aroused, or there was the slightest doubt,
he would hastily secrete himself among shrubbery or weeds,
with which his mottled green sides proved a perfect match, so
that as a whole he blended in admirably with the vegetation.</p>

<p>He did not have a heart, a rather sluggish liver performing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
for him instead the necessary functions of the other organ, and,
as he approached Queen Titania&rsquo;s palace with due caution, it
thumped with
torpid pleasure.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i057.png" width="307" height="272" alt="On the roof" title="" />
</div>

<p>If there was
anything he liked
above all others
it was sneaking,
and the job which
Dragonfel had
given him presented
most attractive
possibilities.</p>

<p>Noting a gurgling
brook in
the proximity of
the portcullis, he took great pains to soak the round pad-like
ends of his tentacles in water so that when they were applied
to a flat surface they would adhere through atmospheric pressure
sufficiently to bear his weight.</p>

<p>In such a manner, when no one was looking, did the wily rascal
climb up the high garden-wall and down the other side, wriggling
and squirming with ill-concealed chuckles toward the palace.</p>

<p>Only the magic dove that Euphrosyne had left, which was
preening itself on the edge of a fountain&rsquo;s basin, saw him, with
the result that it was strongly tempted to fly back to the Goddess
of Mirth forthwith.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i058a.png" width="301" height="230" alt="Window" title="" />
</div>

<div class="figright1">
<img src="images/i058b.png" width="312" height="268" alt="Chimney" title="" />
</div>

<p>At the fountain the Human Octopus took the precaution to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
again soak his multifarious pads in water, after which with his
goggle eyes he cocked his head in a professional survey of the
palace. Then he began to ascend one of its towering walls.
Higher and higher,
and still higher,
he went in perfect
safety until at last
he gained the roof
and squatted on the
top of a chimney.</p>

<p>There he skillfully
compressed
himself to fit the
dimensions of
the flue, after
which he began
to let himself
gently down like
an elevator-car.
A great volume
of black, greasy
smoke from the
kitchen suddenly
belched forth
and hid him
from sight.</p>


<p>It was not so
long afterward that, all covered with soot, he crawled out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the big open fireplace in the throne-room. Before he did so
he made sure to satisfy himself that no one was there. But
there was no telling when someone might come, and he knew it
behooved him to secrete himself and instantly.</p>

<p>His goggle eyes oscillated in all directions around the
room, and he craftily selected for his hiding-place a great
tall clock that stood up close against the wall in a corner by
itself.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i059.png" width="210" height="388" alt="Clock" title="" />
</div>

<p>It was not a grandfather&rsquo;s
clock, for there were no
grandfathers in Queen Titania&rsquo;s
kingdom. It was
what might more properly
be termed a grandmother&rsquo;s
clock.</p>

<p>The villain opened the
door, and projected himself
into the clock&rsquo;s interior, being
obliged in order to accomplish
this to make his
proportions squarish and
oblong. His queer-looking
head showed at the top instead
of the clock&rsquo;s face.
Then with one of his tentacles
glued to the door he
pulled it back in its place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we shall see what
we shall see,&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;I must be patient and bide my
time.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The big brass pendulum swaying rhythmically to and fro
with its measured tick-tock! tick-tock! kept hitting his stomach,
and it tickled him so that it was all he could do to keep from
laughing.</p>

<p>But he knew that he must not do so. If he even snickered he
might betray himself. So he put a number of his tentacles
over his mouth and tried hard to keep a straight face.</p>

<p>Now, though every month was a fair month, a rare month,
for the murmur of the little streams was never hushed, and the
fruits and flowers always were in bloom, with the skies mostly
blue above them, and the winds soft and kind, May to the
fairies&rsquo; way of thinking was the sweetest of all the happy year,
and whenever it came round it was tendered a becoming ceremony.</p>

<p>The Eve o&rsquo; May was a holiday, though it might truthfully
be said that every day was a holiday.</p>

<p>But at this particular time when all nature was at its best
there were special observances that sprang from the gladness
and exultation in all hearts, the very joy of existence, and the
happiness that was manifested by every living thing.</p>

<p>Queen Titania and her fairies prepared for the innocent
revels and dances that were to occur on a velvet sward some
distance from the palace grounds, and their hearts were pleasantly
thrilled by a notice with some pictures of Brownies that
had been mysteriously tacked up in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Marvelous was the flower-texture of the gowns donned for
this gala occasion, and in her robes of blush-pink mossrose
petals which swept away in a long, fragrant train Titania never
looked more beautiful and charming.</p>

<p>Little old Dame Drusilda who resembled a human morning-glory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
with hat, bodice, and dress all like cornucopias, fumed,
fretted, and ordered all the other fairies around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I live,&rdquo; the fussy dame declared, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve forgotten to
wind the big clock, and it&rsquo;s almost run down. Violet and Daffodil,
go to the throne-room, and attend to this before we start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two good-naturedly ran to do her bidding, and when he
saw them coming the Human Octopus had an uneasy qualm.</p>

<p>He hastily tried to distort his ugly face into a resemblance
of the Roman numerals, and stuck up two tentacles for the hour
and minute hands, but the deception was a poor one, and would
not work. Violet and Daffodil set about to wind the clock,
but, on looking up to note the time, they were confronted by a
face twisted in an expression that the Human Octopus very
foolishly thought invited confidence, but which instead sent
them scurrying and hurrying with gathered-up flower skirts
and ear-splitting shrieks from the room.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i060.png" width="306" height="253" alt="Cupboard" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what they&rsquo;re scared of,&rdquo; said the stupid fellow to
himself. &ldquo;Well, it
isn&rsquo;t the first time
I&rsquo;ve given folks a
start in life. And
now it behooves
me to remove myself
from here
forthwith, if not
sooner, for if they
come back and
catch me the jig
is up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tick-tock!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
tick-tock! of the pendulum reminded him that every moment
was precious, so he scrambled out of the clock, and wig-wagged
his way out of the room.</p>

<p>When he came to a fountain he lumberingly clambered up
into the basin, and puddled around in the water to get the soot
off, and once more as the dove watched him perform his ablutions
it found it difficult to refrain from flying back to Euphrosyne.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i061.png" width="302" height="249" alt="Floral urn" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Human Octopus peered through a lattice, but none of
the fairies was in
sight. Then he
hustled up the
garden-wall, and
down the other
side, finally secreting
himself in
a big floral urn
by the portcullis,
where he awaited
further developments.</p>

<p>No one would
have guessed he
was there, for he seemed to be a part of the luxuriant green
growth, and he even let his tentacles droop gracefully over
with the branches and stalks of the palms and ferns to heighten
the illusion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Violet and Daffodil were telling a most harrowing
story to Queen Titania and the rest of the fairies, but so frightened
were they still that it was hardly intelligible. Finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
they were all prevailed upon to accompany the two to the
throne-room to see for themselves.</p>

<p>Nothing was inside the clock, of course, but the brass works.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me you both have very vivid imaginations, young
ladies,&rdquo; chided Dame Drusilda. &ldquo;After this I would let Welsh
rabbits alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not there now, but it was there,&rdquo; persisted Violet
stoutly, &ldquo;and it was the most dreadful looking thing you ever
saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was worse than that,&rdquo; added Daffodil. &ldquo;It was the most
dreadful looking thing you never saw.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i062.png" width="254" height="244" alt="Bell tower" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Well, even if there was such a horrid creature, it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo;
said Queen Titania comfortingly, &ldquo;so why should we trouble
ourselves about it any longer? It&rsquo;s time for our revels to
begin, and if we don&rsquo;t
hurry up the ice cream
will all melt, and remember
there&rsquo;s angel-cake,
charlotte russe, and lemonade
besides!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tiny Cupids, whose
hearts were going pit-a-pat,
for they believed implicitly
every word that
Violet and Daffodil had
said, hastily gathered up
Her Majesty&rsquo;s train.</p>

<p>All started from the
palace, the portcullis being raised to let them pass, and from
his hiding-place in the urn the Human Octopus with his big,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
gloating, goggle eyes noted every movement that they made.
But they had no suspicion that he lurked among the palms and
ferns.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i063.png" width="247" height="290" alt="Fence" title="" />
</div>

<p>After they had disappeared
from sight he flopped
down, and keeping his
eyes close to the earth
followed the wee footprints
that they made.</p>

<p>His sleuth-like, sneaky
search led him straight to
where the fairies sported
on the green, and as he
drew nearer to them he
exercised more caution.</p>

<p>He compressed himself
more closely to the
ground, and picking out a
luxuriant clump of peculiar rainbow roses whose leaves afforded
a most effective screen he crawled to it to wait and bide
his time.</p>

<p>As he watched the innocent, happy fays garlanded with fragrant,
many-hued flowers pose and pirouette he could not deny
to them with a certain grace that many enthusiasts would have
pronounced most exquisite. But he had never been to dancing
school, and he did not trip the light, fantastic tentacle himself.</p>

<p>He was greatly interested in all he saw, however, and even
more so when at last he noticed Queen Titania, the Cupids, and
several of the fairies leave the lithe, flushed, happy group. For
Queen Titania had spied the rainbow roses, different from all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the rest, and ran with eager, sparkling eyes to fill her arms with
them. Little she dreamed of the danger that lurked in all
their perfumed radiance. Swiftly she came, outdistancing the
others, and as she bent over in sweet, innocent pillage the mean,
contemptible nature of the Human Octopus manifested itself.
Forgetful of his diplomatic mission, he wound his tentacles
around her until she looked like a mesh-bag. When she began
almost instantly to scream he grimly increased the pressure.
The fairies and Cupids, horrified beyond measure by
what they beheld, and helpless to aid their beloved queen, fled
with wild cries.</p>

<p>The Human Octopus tightened his cruel grip. Titania&rsquo;s
head fell back, her golden hair streamed over her shoulders,
her eyes distended, and she could not get her breath.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely the Human Octopus was strangling her!</p>

<p class="st">FLORIMEL IS ADOPTED BY<br />
KING STANISLAUS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Delighted</span> beyond measure were
all the Brownies with Prince
Florimel&rsquo;s most amazing feat,
and their pleasure manifested
itself in broad smiles upon
smug faces, the nodding of
round little heads, the slapping
of hands on each other&rsquo;s backs,
and the good-natured poking of
fists in each other&rsquo;s stomachs.</p>

<p>They pressed close to Florimel and kept wringing his hand in
congratulation. Not even a Brownie could do what he had
done.</p>

<p>All wanted to examine the bow that had accomplished a
result so wonderful. But it was just like the ordinary bow of
any archer, and its wood and gut presented no solution of the
remarkable happening; it was no story, they saw it themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, noting that Florimel&rsquo;s attire was torn in many places,
and that here and there his fair flesh showed, they stripped him
of his garments, replacing them with skin-tight trousers that
with the greatest difficulty they drew over his legs, long, tapering
shoes, a jacket with big buttons, and a pinnacle-shaped cap
whose top could not sustain itself but fell over on his head.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i066.png" width="329" height="274" alt="Melon" title="" />
</div>

<p>Many nimble hands attended to his valeting, and though
Florimel observed that he was garbed as an ordinary Brownie,
of which there were a large number, he was rejoiced at the
eagerness they now displayed to transform him to a Brownie,
and make him one of themselves. Yet he could not help thinking,
as he glanced
first at them,
and then at himself,
how different
he was from
them all.</p>

<p>Try as they
might they
could not bestow
on him the
pop eyes, big
ears, and broad,
distended mouth
that parted in
a smile so evident
of inward satisfaction. He was as fair and sightly as
one could wish to be, yet he would rather have looked like a
Brownie. Only in size did he resemble one.</p>

<p>Some such thought must have been in the minds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Brownies too, for they seemed puzzled as they inspected their
new comrade.</p>

<p>While they were making their first awkward overtures of
friendship the attention of all was suddenly diverted to two
ordinary Brownies rolling a watermelon up the steep hill. The
melon was perhaps thrice their size, and they puffed and
grunted over what to them was a herculean task.</p>

<p>Just when their
labor promised to
be light, with the
crest of the hill almost
reached, they
stopped to take
their breath, and
in doing so relinquished
their
hold on the melon.</p>

<p>Bumpety-bumpety!
it
started rolling
down the hill.
Both ran after
it in pursuit,
then realizing
that they were
being distanced
stood stock-still with horror on their faces. Bumpety-bumpety!
came the big melon, with ever increasing momentum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
while the eyes of Florimel and all the rest
followed its erratic course down the hill&mdash;bumpety-bumpety!&mdash;with
leaps and bounds&mdash;bumpety-bumpety!&mdash;first
to one side, then
to another, bumpety-bumpety!&mdash;till it finished
with an extra high
bound and squashed all
to pieces right in their very midst. Little jets of sweet water
shot in all directions from its sides as though projected from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a syphon, and out from the juicy, luscious, red pulp exposed
to view there crawled sheepishly on his hands and knees a little
weazened old fellow
who wore an ermine
cape and gold crown.</p>
</div>

<div class="i069">

<div class="block325">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block325">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&ldquo;Hail, Your Majesty!&rdquo;
shouted all
the Brownies, and
the little old fellow
stood up, rubbed
himself, and
said, rather ruefully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d rather
reign!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the Brownies, under the leadership of the Dude, yelled,
in perfect unison:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&rsquo;Rah! &rsquo;rah! &rsquo;rah!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stan-is-laus!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Siss-boom-ah!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; graciously acknowledged His Majesty, adding by
way of explanation:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;I chose this watermelon green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shun the treacherous submarine!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then a puzzled expression came to his face as his eye suddenly
observed Florimel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, who&rsquo;s this fellow?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not trying
to make a Brownie of him, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Florimel&rsquo;s heart sank, for he realized that here was the king
himself, whose word was absolute law to all these little people.</p>

<p>If he frowned down on any plans they had made in his behalf,
all the hopes that had sprung up in his breast would be ruthlessly
shattered.</p>

<p>The Brownies seemed troubled too, for they would not have
brought displeasure to King Stanislaus for all the world.</p>

<p>While the new-comer stood looking timidly down, without
daring to meet the questioning gaze of that kindly but august
monarch, his little companions made bold to extol his virtues
real and imaginary till their tongues were all wagging at such
a great rate that Florimel could not help but furiously blush.</p>

<p>First they pointed to the crescent moon, still pierced by the
arrow, averring earnestly that it was Florimel&rsquo;s accomplishment,
and the sudden start King Stanislaus gave when he beheld
this marvel showed that he was properly impressed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they called his attention to the eagles&rsquo; nest high up in
the tree, explaining that it was there they first saw the stranger,
after which they waited anxiously as did Florimel to hear what
His Majesty would say.</p>

<p>King Stanislaus looked not displeased, and one and all took
heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Moses was found among the frogs, and Romulus among
the wolves,&rdquo; said the monarch, with great deliberation, &ldquo;then
an eagles&rsquo; nest is a fitting cradle for a Brownie prince!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This speech caused the Brownies to burst into a sudden wild
cheer that made the welkin ring, for they realized that not only
had King Stanislaus set approval on what they had done, but he
had gone much further.</p>
</div>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i070.png" width="226" height="229" alt="Who is this fellow" title="" />
</div>

<p>He had made Florimel
his heir by adoption, and
successor to the Brownie
throne! &ldquo;See that he is
properly attired,&rdquo; was the
royal command, and once
more Florimel&rsquo;s appearance
underwent a swift and
startling change.</p>

<p>From some invisible
source fresh wardrobe was
supplied, and from a plain,
ordinary Brownie he was transformed into a handsome, dashing
little prince as pert and pretty a sprig of royalty as one
could see in many a long journey over lands where there
were kings and queens with large, flourishing families&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
trunks, doublet, and cape, with a cap that perched jauntily
upon his roguish curls.</p>

<p>Filled with gratitude was he over this great, this unexpected
honor that had befallen him and he expressed his thanks as best
he could feeling that the words he used were poor at best, but
vowing loyalty and obedience in all things evermore to his
gracious foster-parent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will not be so very long, my son, before you occupy
the throne,&rdquo; said King Stanislaus, and his voice took on a
rather pensive tone. &ldquo;A few short years&mdash;a couple of thousands
or so&mdash;and I shall have passed away. When I am gone
I shall leave to you all-out-doors and the love of children, a
priceless heritage which you must treasure tenderly and never
lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came the Brownies with pledges of fealty to their
prince, and Florimel smiled back into their smiling faces, while
all were glad.</p>

<p>The Policeman limping slightly came and offered him his
club, but Florimel good-humoredly refused it, and waved him
aside. The Sailor came next with his spy-glass, but Florimel
laughingly declined it also.</p>

<p>Each of the band in a free-hearted way evinced a desire to
surrender to him his most cherished possession, and much
touched was he by their expressions of good will. But the
most he would accept was an eagle&rsquo;s feather which had been
dropped by one of the birds to the ground, and which the Dude
stuck in his cap.</p>

<p>Soon matters took on their usual routine, and, noticing that
the Policeman limped, King Stanislaus asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Officer, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i071.png" width="454" height="247" alt="Prince" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I fell off the palace-wall last night, Your Majesty, when I
was tacking up the placard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you fall against?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fell against my will. One of the fairy guards mistook
me for an enemy, and fired a charge of shot at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you press a complaint?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I withdrew the charge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Into an admiring group some distance off the well-informed
Dude was instilling the first principles of etiquette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not good form to try to eat your peas with a knife,&rdquo;
he told them. &ldquo;You should spear them with a fork.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the Sailor was growling to the German:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avast there, you lubber! A dog-watch isn&rsquo;t a chronometer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indian with a flourish of his tomahawk came running
to King Stanislaus, and imparted the surprising intelligence:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The dromedary&rsquo;s swallowed all the door-knobs, and the
knobs are in his stomachs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which one of his stomachs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see which looks the knobbiest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Florimel could not but admire the shrewdness of King Stanislaus
in disposing of all matters great and small, and he did not
feel that he could ever reign and be as wise as he.</p>

<p>The little monarch held his subjects under most admirable
control, and in arguments that sometimes rose between them
one word from his lips would effectually settle all dispute.</p>

<p>And so they wandered on and on, hiding away from sight
ere the first rays of the morning sun could strike them, and
sallying forth again when the stars began to shine at night.</p>

<p>Many a harmless prank they played, and helpful deed they
did, in which Florimel took hearty part, and he grew to love
them more and more, as they did him.</p>

<p>One thing was a source of great surprise to him, yet, after
he considered, it was not surprising, which was that all dumb
creatures, whether of the fields or air, were the Brownies&rsquo;
friends, and loved them.</p>

<p>In countless ways they all evinced delight whenever these
good-natured little goblings were at hand, for they knew that
they would help instead of harm them.</p>

<p>Even the savage animals that had so lately thirsted for
Florimel&rsquo;s blood proved tractable, and neither they nor the
Brownies showed the slightest fear of each other. The beasts
grovelled and rolled over with pleasure when the Brownies
playfully yanked and pulled their tails.</p>

<p>All was harmony between them, and the industrious animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
went on with their task
of gathering bones
without caring whether
the Brownies were
near or far.</p>

<div class="i072">

<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall4">&nbsp;</div>

<p>So on they fared
with light hearts that had never a care. The country grew
less wild and mountainous, till there were emerald fields, green
copses, and flowers blooming everywhere. The sweet, caressing
air had just a soft reminder of the sea in it.</p>

<p>And, while they hid away one day in a leafy covert, while the
birds in the branches round them were pouring their hearts
out in gladness, piercing screams suddenly rent the air, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
caused all great alarm. &ldquo;Let us make haste!&rdquo; cried Florimel,
springing to his feet. &ldquo;There is danger in that cry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when he started King Stanislaus tried to hold him
back. &ldquo;Have a care, Florimel!&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;It may be a decoy
to entrap us!&rdquo; &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; said Florimel, struggling.</p>

<p>He broke from King Stanislaus&rsquo;s kindly, well-meant grasp,
and ran with might and main in the direction from which the
terrifying sounds still came. The Brownies looked at each
other in great dismay. Into what danger had their beloved
Prince Florimel so recklessly plunged, and would they ever see
his face again?</p>

<h2 class="left">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="st2">QUEEN TITANIA&rsquo;S<br />
GREAT PERIL</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper2">Prince Florimel</span> sped with the
fleetness of a deer in the direction from
which had come those agonizing cries
for help.</p>

<p>As he fairly flew over the ground
he saw the fairies and Cupids who had
been Titania&rsquo;s companions, and they
pointed in a frenzy of alarm to the
clump of rainbow roses in the midst
of which their unfortunate queen
was in the clutches of the dreadful
Human Octopus.</p>

<p>The monster was still tightening his vise-like grip, and tortured
by the pain of his loathsome embrace, Titania was fast
relapsing into unconsciousness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i075.png" width="455" height="226" alt="Pointing" title="" />
</div>

<p>Florimel drew near, and was aghast at what he beheld.</p>

<p>As his eye took in the frightening spectacle he realized that
there was not a moment to lose.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash he whipped an arrow from his quiver and
placed it to the bow.</p>

<p>He aimed the arrow straight at the Human Octopus, and
back to its greatest tension pulled the cord.</p>

<p>Once again the cord proved true, and the speeding arrow
cleft the Human Octopus in twain.</p>

<p>His shell fell instantly apart, and from the interior there
flew away into space a vapory-looking object with a long,
trailing red cloak that had all the lightness and airiness of
gauze.</p>

<p>Dumfounded was Florimel by this most unexpected and
amazing sight, but there were other matters more urgent and
pressing to demand his immediate attention.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i076.png" width="442" height="374" alt="Cleft" title="" />
</div>

<p>With her strength almost spent Titania reeled and seemed
about to faint, but Florimel sprang to her aid, and sustained her
in his arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>He strove to assure her that there was nothing further to
fear until at last she began to recover her composure.
&ldquo;Noble prince,&rdquo; she murmured, in tones that thrilled him,
&ldquo;you have saved my life, so henceforth it is yours!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Florimel sank upon one knee before her, and kissed the pink
finger-tips of the dainty hand she extended to him.</p>

<p>Looking up into her face, he thought he had never seen anyone
so beautiful as she, while her tiny heart throbbed faster
at the sight of him in all his gallant trappings, and she was
very sure she had never seen anyone so handsome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div class="i077a">

<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall4">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Then came in the greatest excitement all the fairies and
Brownies, for these latter little people when Florimel left them
had followed close upon his heels to aid
him if need be, since, in
spite of mystic power
that had temporarily passed with night, they were too brave to
desert a comrade when
danger
threatened.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockr375">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The
horror
and fear
of what
they had
just witnessed was too much for many of the fairies, and the
kind-hearted Brownies had the interesting task of conveying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
some to places of safety, where they could receive proper treatment.
In this work even the Chinaman willingly assisted.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i078.png" width="454" height="337" alt="To safety" title="" />
</div>

<p>A group of curious sprites with much interest inspected several
of the creature&rsquo;s tentacles, while Queen Titania&rsquo;s overjoyed
subjects crowded around Florimel with such profuse expressions
of gratitude that he was much embarrassed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; cried Violet, and &ldquo;What did I tell
you?&rdquo; echoed Daffodil, while all with much timidity examined
the green, mottled shell that lay in halves upon the ground.
&ldquo;That was the horrid thing we saw in the clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind now,&rdquo; said Queen Titania, with a sigh of
relief. &ldquo;The monster will not trouble us again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of what the queen said, Florimel was not so sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
that they would have no more trouble, since he had seen the
wraith-like Red Spirit fly from the shell of the Human Octopus
off into the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i079.png" width="390" height="202" alt="The shell" title="" />
</div>

<p>Somewhere he feared this strange, evil being lurked to wreak
further harm. Not wishing to cause uneasiness to Queen Titania,
however, he said never a word.</p>

<p>Then Brownies and fairies mingled together in happy, joyous
mood. But Florimel and Titania withdrew from all the
rest, and had eyes only for each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can guess how all this is going to end,&rdquo; said the
Policeman to the Sailor, in a voice that showed great resentment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avast, you lubber!&rdquo; sharply reproved the Sailor. &ldquo;Now
what d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that Florimel has fallen in love with the queen, and
will marry her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can he? Florimel is a Brownie, and Brownies never
marry.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But Florimel is not a real Brownie. He&rsquo;s only been taken
into the band. Just look at them now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sailor cocked his eye to where Florimel was bending
over Titania, with his head very close to hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shiver my timbers!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;They do look orange-blossomy!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i080.png" width="246" height="234" alt="Dame Drusilda and the Dude" title="" />
</div>

<p>Noting the impression Queen Titania was making upon
Prince Florimel, Dame
Drusilda determined to
exercise her arts upon
the immaculate little
Dude, with whom she was
very much taken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; she remarked
to the Student, &ldquo;that he
is connected with the best
families.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, rather
enviously, &ldquo;he sometimes
is by telephone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as soon as she could do so she joined the group in which
the Dude held forth vivaciously, and when opportunity presented
itself contrived to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir, in your pretty ways you remind me of the gallants
of old times!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be able to remember quite far back,&rdquo; he said, as
he looked at her through his monocle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forsooth, kind sir,&rdquo; she hastened to say, &ldquo;I only speak
through hearsay. What I know my great-grandmother told
my grandmother, who told my mother, who in turn told me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
As you can plainly see I am different from other fairies. They
call me a beauty of the old school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t school been out a good many years?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fail to comprehend you,&rdquo; she said, with a blush. &ldquo;Mayhap
you are not susceptible to beauty. Yet I have heard it often
remarked that a beautiful woman can make the strongest man
go down on his knees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Dude gave his cuffs an admiring glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So can a collar-button!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The day passed in sports and merry-making, followed by
other days in which the Brownies remained in close proximity
to the palace. During all this time Florimel and Titania were
much together, and their attachment for each other was remarked
by all.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i081.png" width="405" height="267" alt="Merry-making" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Brownies, growing uneasy over the thought that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
might lose their new companion to whom they had become so
friendly, were eager to move on in quest of fresh scenes and
adventures.</p>

<p>King Stanislaus, with the belief that this might be a passing
fancy on the part of Florimel, humored his wishes, and ordered
the band to remain. When he reached the definite conclusion
that it was not, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son, we have been here now quite a long time. Do you
not think we had better seek some other place where we can
do good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Florimel&rsquo;s face showed his disappointment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter where one may be,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there are always
plenty of opportunities to do good. Why not continue here,
where we are all so happy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope to make Titania my wife,&rdquo; said Florimel simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where you are happiest of all,&rdquo; said His Majesty, with
a knowing wink. &ldquo;Ah, Florimel, my boy, your whole life-story,
like nearly every other man&rsquo;s, may be summed up in just
these three words: hatched, matched, dispatched! Tell me
how far matters have gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked anxiously at King Stanislaus&rsquo;s face, as though he
feared to see displeasure written there, but the genial, encouraging
smile upon the royal countenance caused him to take
heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be sorry to lose a son,&rdquo; said the kindly monarch,
&ldquo;but I shall be rejoiced to gain a daughter. Frankly it has
always been my great desire to have an alliance of the Brownies
and fairies, for together we can do more good than if we worked
alone. But until you came I never knew how this could be
effected, for Brownies can never marry.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Much pleased am I by those words, Your Majesty,&rdquo; said
Florimel. &ldquo;I do not deny that I wish to be with Titania, for
my feelings as far as she is concerned are too plain to be disguised.
Still it is not alone the joy of being near her that causes
me to wish this, but the thought that harm may come to her at
any time, in which case I might be able to be of service to her.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i082.png" width="445" height="345" alt="Brownies and Fairies" title="" />
</div>

<p>King Stanislaus seemed very much surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harm!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What harm can befall her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget the great danger she was in from the Human
Octopus,&rdquo; reminded Florimel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Human Octopus is no more,&rdquo; said the king.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
&ldquo;There is nothing to fear on that score, drop him from memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still Dragonfel the enchanter has made his threats,&rdquo;
said Florimel. &ldquo;They may be wild, foolish threats, yet they
cause me great uneasiness. I fear for the queen because of
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he told the king for the first time how the Red Spirit,
after the Human Octopus had been cleft in twain by the magic
arrow, had flown away into the air, to bide his time, perhaps
for further mischief and wrong-doing.</p>

<p>His Majesty&rsquo;s little weazened face turned very grave at
the recital.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, Florimel, I would not worry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will caution
all the band to keep a sharp look-out for the rascal. And
do you, my son,
woo and win,
Titania, for my
blessing will fall
upon you both.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i083.png" width="322" height="244" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>To that end
Florimel exerted
himself,
but it was an
easy task, since
Titania loved
him fully as
dearly as he
her. So when
they were seated once at twilight on a stone bench in the palace-garden,
very close to each other, he asked the question ever
trembling on his lips, and she did not say him nay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Florimel took a slender circlet of gold and placed it
on her tiny engagement finger. But, while she first looked at
it, then pressed it very tenderly to her little red pouting lips,
the Red Spirit suddenly darted from behind the bench, where
he had been eavesdropping all the while.</p>

<p>Before Florimel could reach for an arrow the other flew off
in the air and disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Titania cried, in great alarm.</p>

<p>Florimel strove to ease her mind, though he was much
alarmed himself.</p>

<p>He felt that the Red Spirit was going to make trouble.</p>

<h2 class="left4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="st">THE COMPACT WITH<br />
VULCAN</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Over</span> the sea Dragonfel the
enchanter waited with
increasing impatience for
the Human Octopus to
return with whatever information
he might glean
in his prowling, sneaking
manner. When his
grotesque emissary did
not put in a prompt appearance
he grew more
surly and ill-humored than ever. He vented his rage upon
the poor little mine-sprites by increasing their working-hours
and decreasing their allowance of carrot-tops and potato-skins.</p>

<p>Whenever he spoke to his followers their knees knocked
together with fright. At no time was he gentle, but when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was particularly violent, which was nearly always, he was a
very bad person who could be well avoided.</p>

<p>So he became even crankier and crosser-grained than ever,
till all around him quaked with fear. He wondered why the
Human Octopus did not come back, and his inexplicable delay
filled him with ungovernable fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not attending to business,&rdquo; he said, grinding his teeth
with rage. &ldquo;Instead of snooping he&rsquo;s just going around, and
having a good time. But wait till he gets back, and I&rsquo;ll show
him!&rdquo; As he spoke these words he happened to be in his
throne room, and he went to the open window to look out.</p>

<p>It was a wild, terrible night, but the worse the weather was
the more Dragonfel
liked it.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i086.png" width="306" height="270" alt="Messages" title="" />
</div>

<p>The lightning
zig-zagged all
over the inky
black sky, the
thunder roared,
the wind howled,
and the rain beat
down in slanting
torrents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vulcan must
have some little
job on hand,&rdquo;
Dragonfel pondered,
as he returned to his throne.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he done so when there came a sudden fierce
gust of wind that blew the Red Spirit through the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
right to his very feet where he cringed and grovelled and
fawned in the most abject manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How now, you rogue?&rdquo; roared Dragonfel above the storm.
&ldquo;Where have you been, and what has kept you? Why have you
not returned as you went? Answer, villain, or it will go hard
with you! I will have you strung up by the finger-tips till your
toes barely touch the ground and beaten by a thousand and one
whips!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, master, kind master,&rdquo; gasped the Red Spirit, trying to
catch his breath, &ldquo;wonderful things have I seen, and wonderful
things have I to tell you. So incredible are they that you
may not believe me, yet I do assure you most positively that
what I am about to relate is the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth. I would never have believed them
myself had I not seen them with my own eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Omit all this long, unnecessary preamble,&rdquo; growled Dragonfel,
in great disgust, &ldquo;and get down to hard facts. What
have you discovered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Brownie prince is to wed the fairy queen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dragonfel&rsquo;s face went from scarlet to white, then from
white to scarlet, then back to white, and then to scarlet again,
just like the flashing of a vari-colored electric sign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he asked, trying to control his temper.
&ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; said the trembling Red Spirit. &ldquo;I saw him place
an engagement-ring on her finger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; declared Dragonfel, in a tone of the utmost brutality,
&ldquo;if they are planning to get married all I&rsquo;ve got to say
is they&rsquo;ve got another guess coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who will prevent the marriage, kind master?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will prevent it!&rdquo; irascibly shouted the enchanter, and he
clapped his hands together in an imperious way. &ldquo;What ho,
without there! Here&rsquo;s a pretty kettle of fish! Come hither
instantly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grouthead, Mandrake, Boundingbore, Wolfinger, Snoutpimple,
and others were out in an ante-room, and they almost
tumbled over each other in their frantic haste to answer the
peremptory summons.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i087.png" width="382" height="391" alt="Vulcan&rsquo;s door" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Put on your storm-cloaks immediately,&rdquo; ordered Dragonfel.
&ldquo;I want you to come with me to Vulcan&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible night to be out, kind master,&rdquo; ventured
Grouthead, with a shudder.</p>

<p>There came a flash of lightning and a crash of thunder
more terrifying than any that had gone before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the night?&rdquo; snapped Dragonfel.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with it. I call this particularly
pleasant weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; Grouthead hastened to say.</p>

<p>So in their long, flowing cloaks they all sloshed out in the
wind and rain, while the hearts of those who followed after
the enchanter quaked and quailed as they plunged on through
the pitch-black darkness of the night.</p>

<p>The wind howled and shrieked with increasing fury, the
lightning grew sharper, and the peals of thunder more deafening,
so that their eyes were nearly blinded, and their ear-drums
rang.</p>

<p>Now not so very far from Dragonfel&rsquo;s palace Vulcan whom
they had set forth to see had his cavern.</p>

<p>It was a very modest establishment indeed, considering the
prodigious results that he achieved, and the wonder was that
in such cramped quarters, and with so few to aid him in his
work, he could do as much as he did.</p>

<p>The cavern was down by the sea, in among huge rocks and
boulders, and over the door, in very modest lettering, was the
business sign: <span class="smcap">Vulcan God of Fire</span>.</p>

<p>Inside was a forge with bellows such as any country blacksmith
has, and here Vulcan manufactured earthquakes and
volcanos at will.</p>

<p>He could create seismic disturbances all over the world, in a
trice throw Vesuvius into hysterical contraptions, or make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
things suddenly red-hot in Mexico or the British Honduras.
His wares were known in every quarter of the globe, and he
didn&rsquo;t even so much as advertise.</p>

<p>On this particular night he stood as usual at his forge&mdash;a
great big, husky, bearded fellow in a red flannel undershirt
bared at his brawny, hairy chest, and with sleeves rolled almost
up to his shoulders to give the tremendous muscles of
his arms full play.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i088.png" width="459" height="402" alt="Vulcan threatening his imps with a hot poker" title="" />
</div>

<p>He wore a round leather cap and had on a leather apron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
tied to his burly waist by leather thongs. Things needed
touching up a bit, and he was getting busy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are those lazy &rsquo;prentices of mine?&rdquo; he roared, in
rumbling tones, as he pumped the bellows, while the flames in
the forge leaped higher and higher. &ldquo;Spry, Flash, Nimble,
Twist, and the rest of you&mdash;where are you, I say? Has my
voice grown so weak, you rogues, that you cannot hear me?
Come hither this instant!&rdquo;</p>

<p>From all directions in response to the angry summons came
imps in red attire that fitted their lithe, supple bodies as snugly
as the skins of eels.</p>

<p>They somersaulted down the chimney, popped up like jack-in-th&rsquo;-boxes
from the earthen floor, and described parabolas
through the air from the cavern&rsquo;s ceiling, grouping themselves
humbly on their knees before their irate master, with their
arms supplicatingly extended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here at last, are you?&rdquo; again roared Vulcan. &ldquo;And none
too soon, either! Where have you been, imps? Idling your
time away? Quick! heap coals on, all of you, or the fire will
be out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forthwith they flung balls of living fire into the forge, and,
as Vulcan pumped away at the bellows, he burst out in lusty
song:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3a">&ldquo;When the flames leap high<br /></span>
<span class="i3">From the crater to the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I roll up my sleeves with delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When the strongest buildings rock<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To the awful earthquake&rsquo;s shock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trembling millions all confess my might!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The lightning flashed, the thunder crashed, and over all the
storm was heard a voice calling: &ldquo;Vul-can! Vul-can!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Vulcan stopped work while his imps crept stealthily toward
the door to listen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Vulcan at his forge?&rdquo; was shouted in the wind and rain
outside, with the accompaniment of a terrific knock on the
door.</p>

<div class="i089">

<div class="blockall3">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&ldquo;Who dares disturb me on
my busy night?&rdquo; cried Vulcan,
in a towering passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I, Dragonfel, the enchanter,&rdquo; said the voice placatingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; asked Vulcan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come on business of great import, mighty Vulcan!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Enter, then, and be brief,&rdquo; said Vulcan, with scant hospitality.
&ldquo;Remember I have work to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dragonfel and his followers thereupon appeared in the doorway,
and came forward escorted by the imps who evinced the
greatest curiosity in the strange, rain-soaked visitors.</p>

<p>When they were within respectful distance of Vulcan the
enchanter sank on one knee before him, and the rest immediately
followed his example.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why have you sought me out?&rdquo; demanded Vulcan, with
distrust and suspicion on his seamed, rugged face as he sharply
eyed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Vulcan,&rdquo; spoke Dragonfel, in smooth, oily tones, &ldquo;powerful
as I am, I acknowledge you my master. Who else can
match you in your wondrous strength?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come for a favor!&rdquo; grunted the other. &ldquo;Well, out
with it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to tell you about the Brownies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about the Brownies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is to be a marriage in Fairyland. The Brownie
prince is to wed the fairy queen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah! How does this concern me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It should concern you. Listen, Vulcan! There is no authority
for such a marriage in all the annals of mythology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words created a deep impression upon Vulcan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No authority?&rdquo; he repeated slowly, as though he were mentally
digesting what he had just heard. &ldquo;Are you sure of
this?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;There is none, I tell you,&rdquo; insisted Dragonfel emphatically.
&ldquo;It is enough to arouse the anger of the high and mighty gods.
My own power will be diminished, if not lost, should this union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
take place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you using any measures to prevent it?&rdquo;
asked Vulcan thoughtfully. &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; was Dragonfel&rsquo;s decided
response. &ldquo;I am going across the sea with these followers
of mine to interfere. Can I rely upon your powerful aid
should I need it?&rdquo; &ldquo;How can I help you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;If I call upon you will
you convulse
the earth, and
rouse to fury
the slumbering
volcano?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust me for that!&rdquo; cried Vulcan, beginning to pump the
bellows. &ldquo;The element of fire is still my own, to use at will.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>A lightning-bolt hurled itself right in their very midst, and
the resultant thunder-clap brought Dragonfel and his followers
to their feet in sudden alarm. &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; cried Dragonfel
exultingly. &ldquo;It is a compact, then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is my hand on it!&rdquo; said Vulcan, and he crushed that
of the enchanter in his grimy fist. &ldquo;Spry, Flash, Nimble, and
Twist, my crafty imps, shall go with you. Through them
appeal to me. But what do you propose to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a plan, and a good one too!&rdquo; said Dragonfel, in a
confidential manner. &ldquo;You can depend upon it, rats will eat
the wedding-cake!&rdquo; Vulcan&rsquo;s
fancy was so tickled
that he laughed hilariously,
and Dragonfel made bold
to slap him in a familiar
way upon the back. &ldquo;Ho!
ho!&rdquo; Vulcan chuckled. &ldquo;So
rats will eat the wedding-cake,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i091.png" width="240" height="192" alt="&ldquo;Who knocked?&rdquo;" title="" />

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dragonfel went
on. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to the
wedding, gain their confidence
with fine presents, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Vulcan, very much interested. &ldquo;And then&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dragonfel leaned over and whispered something in Vulcan&rsquo;s
ear which caused him to start back in surprise. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he
involuntarily exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you think you can do it?&rdquo; If
Florimel and Titania could have heard the diabolical plan of
the enchanter all the happiness would have vanished from their
hearts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<p class="st">THE STRANGE<br />
WEDDING-GUESTS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Bright</span> and fair dawned the wedding-day
of Prince Florimel and
Queen Titania.</p>

<p>Though all the days vied in
beauty with each other, this one
seemed to be more radiant with
grace and loveliness than usual,
for every living thing loved the
happy little lovers and all Nature rejoiced with them.</p>

<p>The skies put on their tenderest blue, the sun scattered even
more of its golden treasure, the winds grew more balmy and
caressing, while the flowers were prodigal with perfume, and
the birds were tireless with their joyous serenades.</p>

<p>Though the ceremony was not to be performed till eve, still
the fairies were busy with their preparations at sun-up, and
the palace fairly hummed with their activities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Long banquet-tables had been arranged in the throne-room,
and on snowy napery were dishes, cups, and saucers fashioned
with quaint exquisiteness from flowers, and there were lily
chalices of sparkling dew with which to pledge the health of
the happy bride and groom.</p>

<p>In the kitchen a host of willing workers were being directed
by little Dame Drusilda, and their conscientious efforts showed
in ice cream with fruits of all flavors, charlotte russe, mince
pies, plum puddings, all kinds of berry tarts, old-fashioned
strawberry short-cake, peach cobblers, and apple dumplings.
For the menu of the fairies was composed almost entirely of
the most delicious desserts imaginable,
and they ate what they wished,
and as much as they liked, without
ever getting the indigestion.</p>

<div class="i093">
<div class="block200">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block200">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block200">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block200">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall2">&nbsp;</div>

<p>So the day wore on toward dusk, and, though to all the others,
each hour seemed a minute, and each minute a second, Florimel
and Titania in their impatience thought that it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
never end, the very sun seemed to stand still, as upon Gibeon.</p>

<p>He had left the Brownies to their own devices to be with her,
and while they talked of their union now so close at hand both
were arrayed in their fine wedding-garb.</p>
</div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i094.png" width="308" height="285" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Are you happy,
Florimel?&rdquo;
she asked him,
for the thousandth
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happier than
words can say,&rdquo;
was his fervent
response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re
sure you&rsquo;ll never
regret it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, positive,
Titania. I wonder
what&rsquo;s keeping
King Stanislaus and the band. They ought to be here by
this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Florimel, my happiness would be complete were it not
for the thought of Dragonfel.&rdquo; At the mention of the wicked
enchanter&rsquo;s name he gave an involuntary start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t borrow trouble on his account,&rdquo; he said, trying
to speak lightly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s across the sea where he can&rsquo;t hurt
us. Let us think instead of our approaching happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then fairies came skipping and running from the palace,
clapping their hands in sheer delight, cheering, and waving tiny
handkerchiefs at a great rate. And windows gay with flags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and bunting filled with flushed, eager, excited faces all looking
out, while the Cupids were lifted up in arms so they could better
see.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i095.png" width="390" height="302" alt="Waiting" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The Brownies must be coming!&rdquo; cried Florimel to Titania.
&ldquo;Let us go up on the palace-steps where we can get a view of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gallantly offered her his arm, and escorted her to a position
with the rest, from which they could obtain a glimpse of
the road as it wound curving away, with the blue, dimpling
sea beyond.</p>

<p>Down the road came the joyous band, with hearts attuned
to merry-making, and never was a jollier procession.</p>

<p>Beasts and birds alike had freely offered their services toward
making this grand entree as triumphantly imposing as possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and in the long frisking, frolicking,
cavorting line of march were lions,
tigers, elephants, camels, zebras, ostriches,
emus, cassowaries, and many
other creatures of field, forest, and
jungle, four-footed and two, whose
backs bore willingly the burden of the
gay, laughing sprites.</p>

<div class="i096">

<div class="blockall3">&nbsp;</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
But Florimel could not see King Stanislaus among them, and
was much puzzled thereat. When later they were gathered
together, within the garden-walls, and the beasts and birds had
gone away, after eating all the charlotte russe they could, he
inquired the cause of His Majesty&rsquo;s absence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here later,&rdquo; the Student explained. &ldquo;He had
some pressing engagement with the Policeman, and they went
away together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a banging on the portcullis so loud that
it seemed to be made with big wooden mallets. Brownies and
fairies looked at each other in consternation and surprise, while
many a tiny heart began a vigorous thumping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Queen Titania.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are strangers outside the portcullis, Your Majesty,&rdquo;
said the fairy guard, as she squinted with one eye through the
peek-hole.</p>

<p>The banging continued with greater insistence, and, advancing
close to the portcullis, Prince Florimel shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you, and what do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are friends who have come to the wedding,&rdquo; said a
mild, gentle voice from outside, &ldquo;who have come to the wedding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I like that!&rdquo; exclaimed the Dude, in great disgust.
&ldquo;Whoever gave them an invitation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have brought you some fine presents,&rdquo; the voice hastened
to add.</p>

<p>Florimel seemed undecided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we admit them?&rdquo; he asked the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avast, messmate!&rdquo; growled the Sailor. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better
have a look at the presents first!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to fear,&rdquo; said Titania sweetly. &ldquo;Bid the
strangers welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The portcullis was straightway raised, and in trooped a queer,
motley crowd. They were attended by four grinning imps in
red who varied their walk with somersaulting antics, and the
arms of all but the leader were full of presents.</p>

<p>These evidently had been selected with much care and
thought for the wedding, and the same taste and judgment were
shown that can be found in nearly all weddings.</p>

<p>One of them had a gigantic pair of scissors which would have
taken as many as a half-dozen Brownies or fairies to cut with.
Another held a cradle big enough to hold the offspring of a
giant.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i097.png" width="440" height="319" alt="Cradle" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>A third in a cage carried a hen which was alleged to lay
three strictly guaranteed fresh eggs a day. From each hand
of a fourth dangled an immense round clock, and the faces of
them were lettered: <span class="lower">FALSE ALARM. MADE IN DEMONLAND.</span>
A fifth had a pair of abnormal candle-snuffers. Others had
gifts equally absurd and useless.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i098.png" width="243" height="439" alt="Champion Hen" title="" />
</div>

<p>At the instigation of the leader all grouped themselves in a
semi-circle humbly before the bride and groom to-be, and
Florimel, who was still somewhat suspicious, asked:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i099.png" width="305" height="444" alt="False Alarm" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are friends,&rdquo; said the leader, in his gentle voice, &ldquo;most
anxious to pay homage to you.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are friends,&rdquo; said Florimel, &ldquo;we shall be glad to have
you join in our festivities. Do you dance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All shook their heads in unison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you tango or do the fox-trot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again they shook their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or sing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They still shook their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But just you wait till you see them at the supper-table!&rdquo;
said the Dude decidedly.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i100.png" width="405" height="304" alt="Safe Deposit" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Florimel kindly, &ldquo;I trust we shall find
some means for your enjoyment. Have you come far?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the leader, &ldquo;many leagues to do you honor. We
crave your acceptance of these few, simple, unpretentious gifts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
as a trifling evidence of the distinguished consideration and esteem
in which we hold your fair bride and yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was plain that he had first carefully prepared and then
committed to memory such a flowery speech.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i101.png" width="314" height="371" alt="Love and scratches" title="" />
</div>

<p>In their curiosity to examine the presents the Brownies began
to circulate among the strangers.</p>

<p>When in doing so the Chinaman thoughtlessly put his head
between the open scissors-blades the big, hulking fellow who
held them could not repress an evil inclination, and snapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
them together almost instantly so that the head was held between
them in a vise-like grip.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i102.png" width="407" height="391" alt="Caught" title="" />
</div>

<p>Taking note of this another who had the snuffers clapped
the hood forthwith over an ordinary Brownie so it looked as
though he did not have a head.</p>

<div class="i103">
<div class="blockr225">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockr250">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockr275">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockr300">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall3">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall4">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The leader angrily stamped his foot for them to desist from
such rude, ill-mannered antics, whereupon the one reluctantly
released the frightened Chinaman, while the other removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the snuffers from
Brownie&rsquo;s head.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;You must be weary and travel-stained from your long journey,&rdquo;
said Florimel, not knowing what to think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will come with me,&rdquo; said Titania hospitably, &ldquo;I will
see that your wants are provided for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new guests at a signal from their leader rose, and when
he bowed his acknowledgment of the proffered courtesy they
clumsily followed his example, while the imps gloatingly patted
their stomachs.</p>

<p>Titania motioned to Dame Drusilda, Violet, Daffodil, and
some other fairies to accompany her, and they led the strangers
up the steps into the palace.</p>

<p>Florimel was strongly tempted to follow, but just then
King Stanislaus and the Policeman arrived very much out of
breath.</p>

<p>They had come singly, and from opposite directions. Just
outside the portcullis the Policeman had overtaken His Majesty,
and they entered the palace-garden together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Officer,&rdquo; said King Stanislaus, &ldquo;have you anything to report?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; said the Policeman, twirling his club. &ldquo;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
path I took didn&rsquo;t keep straight. My footsteps got so crooked
that I had to arrest them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you discover?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said nothing, sire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But nothing&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t something then it wouldn&rsquo;t be in the dictionary.
But it&rsquo;s no use to argue with you. Did you find a clue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a good one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t in any of the places I gum-shoed to, so consequently
they&rsquo;re eliminated. The deduction I&rsquo;ve arrived at is
that he&rsquo;s in some other place. As he can only be in one place
there&rsquo;s only one place to find. That&rsquo;s easy.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i104.png" width="189" height="270" alt="Patent Churn" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Of whom are you both talking?&rdquo;
asked Florimel curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Red Spirit,&rdquo; said King
Stanislaus. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll catch him
yet. But the lovely bride&mdash;where
is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the palace, Your Majesty,
providing for some newly arrived
wedding-guests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, after you&rsquo;re married,
Florimel,&rdquo; said King Stanislaus
seriously, &ldquo;you must be careful
your wife doesn&rsquo;t lose her
mind.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No nonsense about it. It often happens to a married
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes she keeps on giving her husband a piece of her
mind till finally she hasn&rsquo;t any mind left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Mignonette and Jassamine, ladies-in-waiting to the
queen, ran shrieking from the palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; cried Florimel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The queen!&rdquo; gasped Mignonette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the poor queen!&rdquo; said Jassamine, almost in hysterics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; urged Florimel. &ldquo;Has anything happened to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; wailed Mignonette. &ldquo;She is gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; echoed Florimel, distracted. &ldquo;Gone where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know not,&rdquo; said Jassamine. &ldquo;We have searched the
palace over, and cannot find her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Dame Drusilda?&rdquo; asked Florimel quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is gone too,&rdquo; said Mignonette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Daffodil and Violet are missing,&rdquo; added Jassamine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our strange wedding-guests&mdash;where are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have flown!&rdquo; cried Mignonette and Jassamine together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is they who have taken them,&rdquo; said Florimel, as
he ran toward the palace-steps. &ldquo;Quick&mdash;a search! They
cannot have gone far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Brownies had reached the steps before him, and were
already pointing off at the distant sea-line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sail! A sail!&rdquo; they cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; said Florimel. &ldquo;I see it all now. This is the
work of Dragonfel!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dragonfel!&rdquo; cried one and all together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Florimel. &ldquo;Our unknown guests were Dragonfel
and his wicked followers. He has abducted them, and
flown with them to his country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bowed his head in great despair. King Stanislaus came,
and placed his hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be brave, Florimel!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Brownies will go at
once to the rescue of Queen Titania!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; shouted the Brownies. &ldquo;To the rescue of Queen
Titania!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; asked the despondent Florimel. &ldquo;We have no
ship to take us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quick as a wink King Stanislaus improvised:</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> King Stanislaus announced
to the Brownies that they were
to go at once to the rescue of
Queen Titania he was confronted
by a very serious problem.
There was no craft of
any kind whatever with which to embark upon so hazardous a
voyage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This comes of unpreparedness,&rdquo; growled the Sailor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been trying to impress on His Majesty for years that we needed
some battle-ships, cruisers, and submarines. Dash my top-lights
if we&rsquo;ve got even so much as an old mud-scow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Far off faintly outlined in the gathering dusk was a galleon
with all sails spread which the favoring gales were bearing to
Dragonfel&rsquo;s enchanted country.</p>

<p>King Stanislaus realized the utter futility of trying to overtake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
it with another sailing-vessel even if they had been the
possessors of one. Dragonfel and his confederates had too
much the start of them.</p>

<p>The only recourse left was to follow as quickly as they could
by whatever means were at hand, and, after they reached their
destination, to try to wrest the unfortunate Titania and her
companions from the cruel clutches of their abductors.</p>

<p>King Stanislaus had pledged his word to Florimel that before
morning they would be in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>A raft to the monarch&rsquo;s shrewd, quick-thinking mind seemed
to be the easiest kind of a craft to construct in the short space
of time to do it in order to redeem the royal promise. The
wind was right, so that it would waft them straight to Dragonfel&rsquo;s
country, just as it was now taking the galleon which soon
disappeared beyond the horizon.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i107.png" width="428" height="218" alt="Tools" title="" />
</div>

<p>In crisp, curt tones which showed that he, if anyone, was
able to cope with this most distressing situation His Majesty
gave orders for the immediate building of the raft.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came a hurrying and scurrying of Brownies. Each of
the little fellows was eager to do his share of the gigantic task,
and no one shirked.</p>

<p>Hither and yon, and all about, they flew, a band of willing
workers, and no one got in another&rsquo;s way, so no time was lost.
Wisely enough the king assigned to each what he was best
adapted to do, and there was no grumbling or cavilling at orders,
but a strict obedience in all things. And, wherever such
a spirit is manifested, it is surprising what results can be
achieved.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i108.png" width="421" height="226" alt="Cellar door" title="" />
</div>

<p>The axes rang out sharp and clear in forests, and big trees
toppled down to be stripped in a trice of their leafy branches.
Sweating, puffing, grunting Brownies pulled and tugged and
strained at the logs into which they were cut, and pushed and
shoved, or rolled them when they could, toward the sea-shore.</p>

<p>Here, with their little jackets off, were many other Brownies
hard at work, while the sound of big wooden mallets and iron
sledges was heard unceasingly on all sides as in the busiest shipyard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
while the logs were being nailed and spiked together.</p>

<p>Yet the raft was not composed entirely of logs, but of whatever
else besides that came in handy.</p>

<p>Nimble, fleet-footed foragers at
their monarch&rsquo;s instigation roamed
the country over for anything that
was in the nature of wood.
Some of these brought back
a gate on which was the
sign: <span class="lower">NO ADMITTANCE</span>.</p>

<p>Others came with shutters on which was tacked the placard:
<span class="lower">ROOMS TO LET</span>. And one group triumphantly lugged a dog-house
which they thought would serve as a pilot-house, and to
this on an iron chain was attached a dog, which perforce was
dragged along after it upon its back. So great was their excitement
that they forgot all about the dog.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i110a.png" width="447" height="250" alt="Dog-house" title="" />
</div>

<p>Other members of the band were busy too in different ways.
The Sailor came running with a long pole on his shoulder, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
strung one after another on the pole were a number of round
life-preservers that looked like huge
doughnuts.</p>

the other.</p>

<p>Straining with the
terrific weight the
Twins together
brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a ship&rsquo;s lead, and in stopping to put it down for needed rest one
dropped it on the foot of his unfortunate brother, who held the
injured foot up with his hand, and danced on the well one in
great pain. But when his brother motioned for him to take
up the lead with him again, he did so, and they labored on their
way.</p>

<p>Down on the beach quite a number had found a big anchor
half-buried in the sand. They
had dug it out and were slowly
bearing it with the utmost difficulty
toward the raft.</p>

<p>Time and again they stopped for a brief breathing spell,
standing meanwhile the anchor on its bow, until at last it suddenly
fell over and pinioned a luckless sprite beneath its weight.
He was extricated by his fellows, and, while they continued
puffing with their burden he limped with effort after them,
rubbing his bruised shank.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i113a.png" width="425" height="210" alt="The anchor" title="" />
</div>

<p>The commissary department was active too, and Brownies
came with ample supplies of provisions for the voyage. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
brought sacks of hard-tack and ship-biscuit, and when they
laid them down and sat on them audacious rats ran helter-skelter
<img src="images/i113b.png" class="figleft" width="350" height="286" alt="Ship-bread" title="" />
out
and
scampered
wildly off
in all
directions.
Nothing
was left
undone,
and when
in the
judgment
of the
Sailor it
was about
four bells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the raft had taken marvelous shape and was ready to launch.</p>

<p>With the
combined
strength of
all the band
it was rolled
down the
sloping
sand upon
round logs
until it slid
gracefully
into
the water.
Lanterns lit
it at the corners,
and in the centre on a long stick floated the Brownie flag.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i114.png" width="329" height="258" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>Then all the Brownies clambered on board, and King Stanislaus
gave the order to cast off the hawsers. The fairies, weeping
yet hopeful of the success of the expedition, watched them
from the shore.</p>

<p>But before some Brownies under the instructions of the
Sailor could obey the mandate of the king Mignonette and Jassamine
in wild disorder, and with their hair flying, came running
toward them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dove!&rdquo; cried Mignonette. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve forgotten Euphrosyne&rsquo;s
dove!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jassamine at the same time held up a cage in which the dove
was perched on a stick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Euphrosyne told Queen Titania she was to send it to her if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
ever she was in danger from Dragonfel,&rdquo; Mignonette made
haste to explain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether we&rsquo;ve got room to take it,&rdquo; said King
Stanislaus grudgingly. &ldquo;Besides I think we&rsquo;re able to manage
this little business affair ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, sire,&rdquo; reminded the Policeman, &ldquo;that Noah once
sent out a dove.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said His Majesty, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s hundreds of
years behind the times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still he did not interpose any objections when the Dude
reached forth and grasped the cage, which he set upon the
raft.</p>

<p>Then off they floated without further interruption, the Sailor
and others poling them out through shallow waters till they
could no longer touch bottom. There were no cheers to mark
the departure, for the hearts of all were set with a stern purpose.</p>

<p>As they got farther and farther away the fairies still gazed
at them, until someone said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t watch them out of sight. It&rsquo;s unlucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tide was ebb, and the wind continued steady and true,
so that they made good progress. Some took their little jackets
off to catch each puff of air. The shore-line finally disappeared
from sight, and then the lights twinkling in the windows of
Queen Titania&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>At last they were so many miles from land that the Twins
took frequent soundings with their lead, and the Sailor, who
consulted his compass very often, growled to the watch:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep a sharp look-out, you lubber!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And their plans all would have gone well, and they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
have reached Dragonfel&rsquo;s enchanted country as they intended,
if something entirely unexpected had not happened.</p>

<p>About six bells, as the Sailor reckoned, a sudden storm came
up.</p>

<p>It was a terrible storm, the worst in the memory of the oldest
inhabitant. The Sailor who was most weather-wise of all could
not understand it. But Dragonfel could have done so had he
wished, for the storm had been manufactured at his request
by Vulcan, and it was just as good a sample of what could be
done in a hurry as the Brownies&rsquo; raft.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i115.png" width="444" height="266" alt="Shipwrecked" title="" />
</div>

<p>Suddenly the sky grew black, and the stars were blotted out.
Then almost instantly came a mighty rush and roar of wind,
and the seas ran mountain-high.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avast, you lubbers!&rdquo; roared the Sailor. &ldquo;Take a reef in
your shirts and jackets!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lightning lit up almost incessantly gloomy, frowning caverns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
in the clouds, and the peals of thunder were deafening. The
rain poured down on them in sheets, but still the wind howled
and raged with unabating fury, and they tossed up and down
like a cockleshell.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i116.png" width="398" height="294" alt="Dog-house" title="" />
</div>

<p>In all the turmoil of alarm the frightened Chinaman lost his
balance, and fell overboard, and a huge sea-serpent, with eyes of
fire gleaming like electric lights above distended greedy, waiting
jaws, rose up from out of the water, with its abnormally
long body looking like a series of hoops.</p>

<p>The Uncle Sam Brownie threw out a life-preserver, but the
Sailor with rare presence of mind grasped a boat-hook, and,
skillfully hooking the end of the despairing Chinaman&rsquo;s blouse,
yanked him back on the raft before the monster could swallow
him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>No craft however staunch could withstand such a gale, which
grew and grew in violence.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i117.png" width="255" height="388" alt="The frightened Dude" title="" />
</div>

<p>The raft shivered and
shook under its terrific
strain, and there came
pistol-like cracks at intervals
as the wood
splintered or broke
apart, while nails and
spikes flew up from
the groaning, loosening
timbers.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely the
raft upon which the
Brownies had exercised
such ingenuity and skill
was disintegrating, and
the great danger of the
band increased with
each passing moment.
And in the flashes of
lightning that illumined
the rumbling skies a huge bird with flapping wings suddenly
swooped down, and, seizing the frightened Dude by his
breeches-seat, bore him, dangling face downward, with his
cherished cane still clutched in his hand, up, up, still up, till
he was out of sight.</p>

<p>The others, all aghast, looked up at him until he disappeared,
and wondered if they would ever see him again. And, while
they wondered, with their own misfortune forgotten in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
greater calamity that had come to their beloved companion,
there was heard a crack louder than any that had gone before,
and the raft went all at once to pieces.</p>

<p>Struggling in the water, or clinging to broken spars, logs,
and pieces of timber, the Brownies suddenly found themselves
gasping and choking as relentless waves rolled over them, at
times submerging them.</p>

<p>This was the end, then, of their unfortunate adventure.
There was nothing to cause even the slightest ray of hope.
It looked as though all the Brownies would be lost.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="st">WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
THRONE-ROOM</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Led</span> by Queen Titania, Dame Drusilda,
Violet, and Daffodil, the
strange guests, who had come to
the wedding without an invitation,
mounted the spacious marble steps and passed into the
palace.</p>

<p>In spite of a meek, respectful demeanor that it was very
hard for them to assume, they could not conceal the gloating
satisfaction that was on their faces.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Brownies and fairies were already beginning
to enjoy themselves in different parts of the palace
grounds.</p>

<p>Introductions are hardly necessary when sprites meet, and
many found ways of getting acquainted, and were warm friends
on their first meeting.</p>

<p>Having no suspicion of what was in the evil minds of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
she was preparing so hospitably to entertain, Titania with her
companions ushered them into the magnificent banquet-room.</p>

<p>There upon one of the long tables were spread many delicacies
to make one&rsquo;s mouth water, and, even before an invitation
to partake of them could be extended, the four red imps seated
themselves before it, and, smacking their lips, began to tuck
napkins under their chins.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i120.png" width="396" height="338" alt="Eating imps" title="" />
</div>

<p>Titania had thought that the guests would leave the presents
they had brought out in the hall when they came in, but
they still held on to them with a grip so tenacious that she wondered
if they really meant to give them up, after all.</p>

<p>Nevertheless in a free-hearted way she urged the visitors to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
refresh themselves. The imps were already engaged in trying
to stuff whole plum puddings into their mouths at once, a greedy
proceeding that Dame Drusilda, Violet, and Daffodil watched
with considerable disgust.</p>

<p>All but the leader started quickly to seat themselves, but he
stamped his foot imperiously, and they came to an instant stop.</p>

<p>Then he threw back the hood of his scarlet cloak, disclosing
a wicked face, and transfixed Titania with his malicious gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Dragonfel the enchanter, my fine little lady,&rdquo; he said,
in fiendish tones, &ldquo;and I have come to take you away with me!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i121.png" width="448" height="337" alt="Take you away" title="" />
</div>

<p>Titania was so frightened that she could neither scream nor
run away, and she allowed him to gather her up in his arms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
hold her just as a little girl does a doll, making light of load.</p>

<p>There she lay passive and trembling, with the realization
that it would be useless to make any effort to escape.</p>

<p>Almost immediately afterward Grouthead seized the biting,
scratching, and clawing Dame Drusilda, whom he dumped in
spite of fierce resistance into the baby&rsquo;s crib, and when Mandrake
and Wolfinger put Violet and Daffodil in after her it
was very plain why this particular gift had been selected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;re not going to get these presents, either,&rdquo;
sneered Dragonfel to Titania, who said never a word. &ldquo;You
may call me an Injun-giver, if you like, but I mean to take
them back, just the same!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Titania helpless in his arms he started toward a rear
door, while after him came Grouthead and Wolfinger bearing
the crib in which Dame Drusilda, Violet, and Daffodil rattled
about like dried peas in a pod. The others followed slowly and
reluctantly in their wake, casting longing glances backward at
the tempting-looking desserts on the table.</p>

<p>The imps, however, did not budge, but continued eating.
When Dragonfel called out to them in angry tones they sprang
up and attempted at the same time to jam charlotte russe into
their gaping mouths.</p>

<p>In their frantic haste they smeared the charlotte or russe,
whichever the white part is, all over their faces, so that as
they hurried after the others with occasional frisky somersaults
they looked as though they had just been lathered by a
barber.</p>

<p>Out by the rear all passed into the deserted back-garden
where there was a small iron door locked and bolted from the
inside, and with the key, fortunately for their nefarious plans,
in the lock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Through this door Dragonfel and his followers effected their
escape with their captives, and ran with all possible speed toward
the sea-shore.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i122.png" width="459" height="375" alt="Escape with their captives" title="" />
</div>

<p>The galleon tossed upon the lazy swell, not a great distance
out, and in a small boat with Snoutpimple and Boundingbore
at the oars they rowed to it, and soon were on board.</p>

<p>Then the anchor was weighed, and with all sails filling they
set their course for Dragonfel&rsquo;s enchanted country, which they
reached without mishap of any kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>When they got to their journey&rsquo;s end, and all stood safe upon
the shore, the full malignity of Dragonfel was shown.</p>

<p>Realizing that the indomitable Brownies would not relinquish
Titania without a struggle, but would follow as quickly
as they could to wrest her if possible from him, he ordered
Vulcan&rsquo;s imps to call upon their master to impede them with
a storm.</p>

<p>The imps thereupon cast balls of fire into the air, and, even
as all bent their steps toward the palace, the enchanter noted
with considerable satisfaction quite a change
in the temperature.
Clouds were already
beginning
to form
on the
horizon,
and there came the distant rumble of continuous thunder.</p>

<div class="i123">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>While they stood just outside the massive doors they heard
the sounds of what appeared to be a violent altercation from
within. In an agitated manner, as though he feared the worst,
Dragonfel quickly threw them open, and was greatly relieved
to see the Demon Usher and Red Spirit engaged in a friendly
game of checkers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cheated!&rdquo; the Red Spirit accused hotly. &ldquo;You jumped
three of my men when you should have only jumped two!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; snarled Dragonfel at them. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
how to play checkers, anyhow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sprang in consternation to their feet, upsetting the
board, and causing the checkers to roll all over the floor.</p>

<p>While the Red Spirit stood gloating over the success of a
venture in which he had played a modest part, the Demon Usher
half skipped, half flew, to the throne, and with a display of much
enthusiasm began dusting off the seat with a cloth.</p>

<p>With swaggering stride Dragonfel went to the throne, and
threw himself in it, while Queen Titania, Dame Drusilda, Violet,
and Daffodil all came running toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; cried Dame Drusilda, very much distressed, &ldquo;why
have you brought us poor, defenseless girls here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Us, my venerable fairy!&rdquo; said Dragonfel, most insultingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Venerable!&rdquo; repeated Dame Drusilda. &ldquo;Oh, you nasty
man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you keep your age?&rdquo; he sneered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy enough,&rdquo; she replied indignantly. &ldquo;I never give it
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke she made for him as though she meant to
scratch his eyes out, but Queen Titania pulled her back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch him, Dame Drusilda!&rdquo; she cried, and then
turned pleadingly to Dragonfel. &ldquo;Why have you made me a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
prisoner, and carried me away from home in this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To prevent your marriage to the Brownie prince,&rdquo; he said
coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we love each other, and would be so happy,&rdquo; she said,
while tears filled her pretty eyes. &ldquo;Why do you oppose the
marriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if this marriage were to take place,&rdquo; he said, with
an ugly frown, &ldquo;it would make you all so powerful as to result
in my undoing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fear,&rdquo; she said reprovingly, &ldquo;that we will frustrate all
your wicked plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must not, shall not be!&rdquo; was his decided response. &ldquo;The
Brownies and fairies have long been my enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you did good,&rdquo; she reminded, gently, &ldquo;we would be your
friends. Tell me, must I stay here always?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, always!&rdquo; he snapped out. &ldquo;The sooner you forget
your Brownie prince the better. You shall never see him
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Titania showed her spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I shall!&rdquo; she contradicted. &ldquo;The Brownies will
rescue us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he said contemptuously. &ldquo;Those poor, weak creatures
of the night? They could not do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Brownies can do anything,&rdquo; she said, with perfect trust
and confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My pretty pet,&rdquo; said Dame Drusilda, &ldquo;you waste words with
him. Let us ask some of these other creatures to help us.
Maybe they are not as bad as their master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she coquettishly sidled up to Grouthead, Boundingbore,
Mandrake, Wolfinger, and Snoutpimple who stood near by in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
highly interested group. But before she could say even a word
Grouthead gathered her up in his arms, and held her out in
the air, while in her fright she kept kicking the turned-in toes
of her tiny shoes together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, my dear,&rdquo; he croaked, in tones that were
meant to be reassuring. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a heart here that beats for
you, and you alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the heart?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this troubled breast,&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve half a mind to
marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put me down!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t marry anyone
with half a
mind!&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>Dragonfel rose,
and stamped his
foot angrily, at
which silent rebuke
Grouthead
set Dame Drusilda
hastily down.
She gave a sigh
of great relief,
and, gathering up
her skirts, flew
toward the enchanter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; she implored, &ldquo;can nothing move you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, in sneering tones, &ldquo;a ton of dynamite! You
are a pippin, but you withered on the stem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You villain!&rdquo; she screamed, shaking a tiny clenched fist at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
him. &ldquo;I could annihilate you for that; you deserve worse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she made for him again, but the tactful Violet and Daffodil
grasped each of her arms, and held her back.</p>

<p>Dragonfel grinned most provokingly, and his myrmidons
fairly shook with glee, while the Demon Usher cackled his exultation,
and poked the Red Spirit on his elastic ribs.</p>

<p>Titania took a little spider-web affair of a handkerchief from
her bodice, for her eyes threatened to fill again.</p>

<p>Noting the coming tears, the wicked enchanter hastened
to say, in tones that were meant to be particularly comforting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No harm shall befall you. When you have a wish you
have but to name it.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="i125">

<p>&ldquo;I have one now,&rdquo; spoke up
Titania quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; added Dame
Drusilda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hear
yours later,&rdquo;
said
Dragonfel
to the latter
gruffly, and
then turned
to Titania
with what he thought was a most winning smile. &ldquo;What is
yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want my Brownie prince!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you you were never going to see him again?&rdquo;
said the enchanter, in disgust. &ldquo;Ask me something else, and
make it as hard as you can.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>But Titania had no other wish, and Dame Drusilda was given
no opportunity to make hers known.</p>

<p>The days dragged slowly by, and, though Dragonfel was not
actually rough in the treatment of his captives, he still was most
unkind in depriving them of the liberty for which they continually
sighed. They were watched and spied upon continually,
so there was little or no chance for escape.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>He endeavored to provide amusements for which they had no
heart, and was a sorry host at best. In his crude efforts to entertain
them he welcomed all ideas for sports and diversions,
so when on one occasion they were all together, and his prisoners
seemed unusually depressed, he sat upon his throne
knitting his brows in trying to think of something that might
cheer them up a bit.</p>

<p>In the midst of his unsuccessful cogitations the Demon Usher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
half skipped, half flew, to him, and prostrated himself at his
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kind master!&rdquo; he cried, in a flutter of excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Dragonfel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A band of wandering minstrels outside humbly crave permission
to play before you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, another?&rdquo; said Dragonfel. &ldquo;Show them in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words he used were hospitable enough, but the tone of
his voice boded little good for the daring musicians.</p>

<p class="st">NEPTUNE STILLS<br />
THE WAVES</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Up</span> and down like corks bobbed the
Brownies on the angry waves
when their raft was so suddenly
demolished by the storm. The
blackness of the night was so
intense that even with their supernatural
vision they could not
see each other save in those vivid
streaks of lightning that came often and for a brief moment
made all around as bright as day.</p>

<p>The wild wind and waves bore them farther and farther
apart from each other, so that it was every one for himself,
which was against all principle in a band that delighted in
mutual help.</p>

<p>But in this case they could not give it. The water got in
their noses and mouths, causing them to gasp, choke, and splutter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
while their ears rang, and their eyes were nearly blinded.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i129a.png" width="448" height="254" alt="They clung to the debris" title="" />
</div>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i129b.png" width="327" height="251" alt="Straddled logs" title="" />
</div>

<p>Desperately they clung to the splintered pieces of debris, to
the dog-house
that spun over
and over, to
the gate that
turned upside
down, or
straddled logs
that kept
rolling with
Brownies first
up and then
under like
teetotums.</p>

<p>And others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
not so fortunate, with strength fast leaving them, still swam
the waters seeking and groping in vain for some object to sustain
them.</p>

<p>Then, right in the midst of all their terrible danger, when
hope was fast departing from all hearts, a wonderful thing
happened.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i130.png" width="458" height="310" alt="A wonderful thing" title="" />
</div>

<p>There came a sudden radiance that was not the lightning&rsquo;s
flash, illuminating old Father Neptune and a bevy of lovely-faced
dryads in a golden chariot that furiously galloping seahorses
drew across the waves.</p>

<p>In a brief space no longer than a second the God of the Sea
and his beauteous attendants passed on out of sight, but almost
with their disappearance the lightning and thunder ceased, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
did the rain, the wind died down, the stars once more shone
out, and the water grew as smooth as glass.</p>

<p>When buffeted no longer by boisterous winds and waves the
chance the Brownies had to save themselves increased immeasurably.</p>

<div class="i131">
<div class="blockr175">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockr175">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockr175">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall3">&nbsp;</div>

<p>They could now see and hear each
other, and when some one swimming
in the water called for help there were those on debris
who reached over and pulled their exhausted comrade on board.</p>

<p>They shouted at each other in the dark, and by using their
feet as paddles contrived at last to bring whatever they floated
on close together. Then King Stanislaus, who with Prince
Florimel was a-straddle of a log, with much anxiety began to
take an inventory of the band.</p>

<p>To his infinite relief no one was missing but the Dude, but
this misfortune in itself was enough to dampen their spirits,
for the companion who had been carried off by the gigantic
bird was very much beloved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye!&rdquo; growled the Sailor, cocking his weather-eye out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
through the slats of the hen-coop. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all here, even to
Euphrosyne&rsquo;s dove!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus on they went without further mishap, a queer-looking
flotilla, keeping in as close proximity to each other as they
could, using both hands and feet for paddles, and adopting many
ingenious devices to complete the voyage so disastrously begun.</p>

<p>And a day dawned, then another, but at nightfall of the
second they glimpsed far off a shore-line with a single towering
mountain which they knew to be Dragonfel&rsquo;s enchanted
country.</p>

<p>They were neither hungry nor thirsty, for Brownies if need
be can go without food or water a long time.</p>

<p>Much heartened by what they beheld, they redoubled their
efforts to reach the shore, which grew plainer and plainer, until
finally they could distinguish an immense glittering structure
that looked more like a prison than a palace, built as it
was in the gloomy shadow of the mountain.</p>

<p>Though it gleamed and flashed and shone in a thousand and
one different places, where its myriad jewels caught the light,
it seemed a cheerless, inhospitable place, and they were depressed
by the sight of it.</p>

<p>The galleon that Dragonfel had used to convey his captives
to his country was lying at anchor well in toward the shore,
with no one evidently on board, but not feeling sure of this
the Brownies made a wide detour, choosing for a landing a
sheltered cove that would screen them from observing eyes.</p>

<p>As they drew closer to the land some strange companions
had they&mdash;queer creatures who had obtruded themselves upon
the Brownies during the storm, and forced their society upon
unwilling hosts&mdash;a motley gathering from air, sea, and undersea
that occupied choice places upon the flotsam and jetsam to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
which the little fellows so precariously clung with amazing vim.</p>

<p>There were comical-looking, long-legged, long-billed cranes
and herons, and squat-flappered, web-footed penguins. The
walrus and seal were there, as well as formidable members of
the finny tribe, some of which had swords so sharp that the
discreet Brownies kept a most respectful distance from them.
Crustaceans too were represented, with here a lobster slyly
nipping a sprite&rsquo;s toe with his claws, and there a turtle tweaking
another&rsquo;s cap.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i132.png" width="445" height="257" alt="These false whilom friends" title="" />
</div>

<p>But when the Brownies reached shoal water, and some began
to wade toward shore, these false whilom friends deserted
them, and dived into the deep, or flew off in the air.</p>

<p>Then when they were safe at last on land they stretched their
weary, stiff, cramped legs and arms, or raced about the sand
to get the sluggish blood once more pulsing through their veins.</p>

<p>King Stanislaus stood apart from all the rest, and watched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
their joyous antics with an expression of deep thought on his
august countenance. It was plain to be seen that he was greatly
troubled in his mind.</p>

<p>Now that they had succeeded in reaching Dragonfel&rsquo;s country
what steps should be taken in the effort to recover Queen
Titania and her companions? It was not to be conceived that
the wicked enchanter would give them up without a bitter
struggle.</p>

<p>The problem confronting the Brownie band was one that
required the most careful consideration. A single false step
might ruin all.</p>

<p>While the monarch pondered over what was best to be done
his eye abstractedly roved to the Brownies who now had gathered
in a circle on the beach, and who were scanning with much
interest something in the sky.</p>

<p>The Policeman involuntarily had pointed his club toward it,
and the Sailor was trying to get a better view through his spy-glass.</p>

<p>The royal eye at once turned upward in the direction in which
all the others were gazing, and like everyone else was held
spellbound with surprise.</p>

<p>Far overhead there was an immense bird slowly dropping
with stationary wings outspread down toward them. It stood
out clearly outlined in silhouette against the dark night-sky.</p>

<p>But it was not this bird, remarkable in itself, that created
such intense excitement on the part of all.</p>

<p>Its great sharp talons held in a firm grip an object that they
recognized at once, with the result that delight and consternation
were mingled on their faces.</p>

<p>Grasped firmly by the coat-tails, with face downward, and
legs and arms spread out like a Maltese cross, was the immaculate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Brownie
Dude, and he
still was
clutching in
his right hand
the cane that
was his most
treasured
possession
outside of
his monocle.
The Brownies
watched
this most
extraordinary
spectacle
as though they were fascinated, and their pop-eyes almost
popped out of their heads.</p>

<p>Lower and lower settled the great bird, and the anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
watchers now realized that its offices toward the Dude in time
of danger had been of a most heroic nature.</p>

<p>With great haste some secured a net, which they held outspread.
When the bird was still some distance above, it cocked
its eye as though it were making some nice calculation and suddenly
let go of its burden.</p>

<p>The Dude came hurtling through the air, landing safely in
the net, while the bird sailed off, and was soon gone from
sight.</p>

<p>As soon as the Dude got on his feet he started to dust off
his clothes with a tiny whisk-broom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t care to go up in an aeroplane!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>He looked infinitely relieved when one of the overjoyed
Brownies who crowded around in congratulation handed him
his opera-hat box.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i134.png" width="333" height="221" alt="The Fairies attempted to follow their queen" title="" />
</div>

<p>It may here be mentioned, that the Fairies, who had been left
behind, made a desperate attempt to follow their Queen, and
the Brownies, across the sea. But, after great difficulties, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
dangers, they were glad to get back
to their own shore in safety.</p>

<div class="i135">
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="block175">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block175">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block175">&nbsp;</div>

<p>But though Florimel, like all the rest,
was delighted beyond measure that the Dude had been so
miraculously restored to them, so they were now once more
complete, he could not restrain his tortured feelings when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
thought of Queen Titania, and he was in a fever of impatience
to rush at once to her rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We only waste time here while Titania may be in danger,&rdquo;
he said, with a strong trace of irritation in his tone. &ldquo;Is not
that Dragonfel&rsquo;s palace over yonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>King Stanislaus gazed at the highly expensive but forbidding-looking
edifice toward which Florimel pointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; was his guarded response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let us storm it, and force him to surrender the queen
and her companions!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; cried all the Brownies.</p>

<p>But King Stanislaus shook his head in a very decided manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son, you&rsquo;re too impulsive,&rdquo; he said kindly but reprovingly.
&ldquo;Judging from what you&rsquo;ve told me, for I&rsquo;ve never
seen any of them, each of those fellows must stand full six
times as high as one of us, and there may be six times as many
besides. We must exercise caution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you anything to propose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing just now,&rdquo; said King Stanislaus. &ldquo;We must
reconnoitre a bit, and get the lay of the land, before considering
any plan whatever. An open attack would be entirely out
of the question. They&rsquo;d have the advantage of us in size and
maybe numbers. No, no, my boy, we must use Brownie cunning.&rdquo;
Reluctantly Florimel was obliged to admit the force
of the shrewd old monarch&rsquo;s reasoning.</p>

<p>Concerned as he was in mind to rescue Titania as soon as
he could, he had no desire by any rash act to imperil or, even
worse still, destroy the entire band.</p>

<p>King Stanislaus motioned to the Brownies, who drew closer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to give respectful heed to what he might have to say to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want each of you to go out and see what you can learn,&rdquo;
he instructed. &ldquo;But, as you value your life, and the lives of
your fellows, you must not allow yourselves to be seen or heard
by anyone. When a half-hour has elapsed we will assemble
here.&rdquo; Following His Majesty&rsquo;s directions, the willing band
immediately dispersed, Florimel choosing a way to take alone,
as did each other, and so careful were they all that no one in the
neighborhood would have suspected they were near.</p>

<p>When the half-hour was up King Stanislaus was back on the
same spot, and the Brownies began to pop up in the dark around
him from all sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; His Majesty asked, &ldquo;have you found out anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then one after another was obliged to confess that he had
not, and while he was questioning them in turn he ascertained
that neither Florimel nor the Policeman had returned.</p>

<p>The fact that both were missing worried him not a little, but,
even while he was wondering what had kept them, he beheld the
Policeman returning with incredible speed, leaping and bounding
with his long, tapering feet over the sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; he panted, as he came up out of breath,
&ldquo;I have just made a remarkable discovery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, officer?&rdquo; asked King Stanislaus, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I told you,&rdquo; said the Policeman,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t
believe me. I want you all to
come and see for yourselves!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

</div>

<p class="st">WHAT THE POLICEMAN<br />
DISCOVERED</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Like</span> a covey of startled quail the
Brownies flew after the Policeman,
for each was very curious
to learn of the discovery that
he had made. They knew that with his keen sense of dramatic
values he wished to keep them in suspense as long as
possible, so that only at the proper moment would the mystery
be solved.</p>

<p>His fleet little feet padded along the sand, followed by others
equally so, and he led them a stiff pace for perhaps a mile down
the beach.</p>

<p>There lying behind a dune that offered a shelter from the
creeping tides they viewed the cause of all his excitement.</p>

<p>Scattered on the sand were some dingy old frayed uniforms,
caps, and hob-nailed shoes, of which they counted five complete
sets in all, while near by piled into a heap were some immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
brass musical instruments, some bent and battered in
places and all tarnished by the weather.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i138.png" width="392" height="222" alt="Uniforms and caps" title="" />
</div>

<p>Soon they were making a minute inspection of these objects
which for some inexplicable reason had been abandoned by
their owners. The uniforms and caps were of worn blue cloth,
and the latter had visors and braids of gold around them. The
sleeves of the coats likewise were braided with gold.</p>

<p>With much interest in their work the Brownies began to
separate the instruments that formed a heap. There were
two cornets, a saxophone, a trombone, and a tremendous tuba
that wound around and around and had a mouth so big that
a Brownie could have easily crawled inside.</p>

<p>While they were examining the outfit there was much speculation
as to whom it belonged, and the only conclusion they
could arrive at was that the original possessors had been some
itinerant German band.</p>

<p>It was not so strange to them that a German band should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in Dragonfel&rsquo;s enchanted country, for they knew that German
bands go everywhere. Sometimes they can be found even at
the North Pole. The only strange thing about it was that while
the uniforms and instruments were there, the owners were
missing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s become of the band?&rdquo; said King Stanislaus,
very much puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps someone heard them play,&rdquo; suggested the Dude.</p>

<p>His Majesty gave a sudden start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;What you have just hinted at
rather unsettles an idea that suddenly occurred to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you were thinking of the same thing I was,&rdquo; said
the Policeman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very possible,&rdquo; said the monarch, &ldquo;for great minds
sometimes think alike. I was thinking that some of us could
disguise ourselves as a German band and maybe gain admittance
to the palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I was thinking,&rdquo; said the Policeman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that way,&rdquo; went on King Stanislaus, &ldquo;we might be able
to get some knowledge of Dragonfel&rsquo;s real strength, and find
out just how we stood. The chance might come to us to spirit
away Queen Titania and her companions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which of us would you choose, Your Majesty?&rdquo; asked an
eager Brownie.</p>

<p>All of them crowded around, each with the hope that King
Stanislaus would select him for this task which involved so
great a risk.</p>

<p>He looked them over, and finally, with his mind made up,
spoke, in slow, measured tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll be the leader,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;That will
leave just four to go with me, and I&rsquo;ll take the Policeman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Sailor, German, and Irishman. The rest of you must hide just
outside the palace, to be ready instantly in case you are needed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was great delight on the part of the four who were to
share with the king the danger, and keen disappointment among
all the others. But no one thought of questioning the royal
decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t forget my tin box of disguises, sire,&rdquo; reminded
the Policeman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good, officer!&rdquo; said King Stanislaus, with an approving
nod. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all come in handy. You&rsquo;ve got plenty of false
noses and moustaches, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i139.png" width="381" height="224" alt="False noses and moustaches" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Policeman gave a knowing wink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need a rehearsal, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the Dude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said King Stanislaus decidedly. &ldquo;The worse we play
the cleverer will be the deception.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he and the four selected by him began to make preparations
for their queer masquerade, and in these the whole band
assisted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
The coats and
trousers had
probably hung
on their original
wearers
badly, but
they fitted the
Brownies who
tried them on
much worse.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i140.png" width="331" height="270" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>The general
effect would
have brought
deep shame to
any conscientious
tailor who had made them, but nimble fingers soon accomplished
wonders with a tuck here and there, and the deft
use of an occasional pin.</p>

<p>The ends of the trousers had to be rolled up a number of
times, and the coats turned up on the inside. When they put
on the big, hob-nailed shoes their long, tapering feet were lost
in them, and the whole Brownie identity completely disappeared
after they had donned the false noses and moustaches that the
Policeman handed around.</p>

<p>No one familiar with the Brownie band would have recognized
these particular five, and their disguise was pronounced
admirable by one and all.</p>

<p>The breast of the coat that had fallen to the Sailor was all
covered with medals, and it was the only one of the lot that
was decorated in this manner. King Stanislaus thought that as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the leader he was more properly fitted to wear this coat, but
the Sailor seemed reluctant to give it up, so His Majesty good-naturedly
did not press the matter.</p>

<p>He chose a cornet and the Sailor the remaining one. The
Policeman took the saxophone, and the German the slide trombone.
That left only the tuba for the Irishman, and it was so
big that he could hardly manage it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i141.png" width="395" height="230" alt="Dressing" title="" />
</div>

<p>Thus fully equipped and with the whole band for an escort,
the indomitable quintet set forth on their delicate mission.</p>

<p>Dragonfel&rsquo;s palace was a good deal farther away than they
had supposed, for the atmosphere was very clear, so that objects
at a distance seemed much nearer than they really were.</p>

<p>There was a fair road that led to it from the beach, and this
took them over a rickety wooden bridge that spanned one of
the numerous tide-water creeks in the vicinity.</p>

<p>But before they reached the bridge they came to a small
frame structure over whose arched doors was the sign:
<span class="lower">NEPTUNE HOOK AND LADDER CO. NO. 1</span>, which caused remarks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently Dragonfel has a fire department,&rdquo; said King
Stanislaus. &ldquo;This is a most interesting discovery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I could have told you that,&rdquo; said a Brownie. &ldquo;I saw
it some time ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have done so,&rdquo; His Majesty reproved. &ldquo;It
may have a very important bearing on what we are about to
try to do. But what was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something dim and shadowy flitted past in the dark, with
the whirring sound of a night-bat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw it,&rdquo; the Policeman spoke up quickly. &ldquo;There was a
gleam of red, and I thought I could distinguish a bow and
quiver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bow and quiver!&rdquo; repeated King Stanislaus, and his face
grew suddenly grave. &ldquo;I hope they were not Prince Florimel&rsquo;s.
I am greatly distressed by the fear that some dire mishap
has come to him.&rdquo; His Majesty would have felt very
much relieved in mind if he could have known that nothing
serious had occurred to the prince.</p>

<p>When like the rest of the Brownies Florimel had gone to
seek what information he could he had strayed nearer to the
palace than perhaps in prudence he should have done.</p>

<p>With the impetuosity of youth he was ready to storm the
palace single-handed, but he realized that such a rash, foolhardy
attempt would only bring disaster to the whole band.</p>

<p>So he gazed toward the lights that gleamed from the windows,
wondering all the while what Titania was doing at the
time, and if Dragonfel was very cruel to her.</p>

<p>He was really helpless just then to exert himself in her behalf,
and he turned with a sigh to go back.</p>

<p>The rigors of the hardships through which he had passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
pressed heavily, and excessive weariness overcame him. He
felt a sudden faintness, and sank upon a grassy bank to rest.</p>

<p>He did not dream that prying eyes for some time had been
watching him from an open panel in a fence hard by.</p>

<p>Those keen, malicious orbs followed every movement that
Florimel made, and when they noticed him yawn, and rub his
lids to keep the sleep from them, they glittered and gleamed
with exultation.</p>

<p>Then Florimel&rsquo;s eyes in spite of him closed, and his tired
head sank back in the deep grass.</p>

<p>From the fence the Red Spirit issued like a wraith. Noiselessly
he advanced toward the unconscious prince, and bending
down began with deft, adroit fingers to remove the quiver
slung across his back.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i142.png" width="448" height="185" alt="Fully equipped" title="" />
</div>

<p>But light as the thieving touch was it aroused Florimel who
sprang at once to his feet.</p>

<p>Quick though he was he still was not quick enough. All that
he heard was a whirring sound, and in a flash he noticed that
his bow was missing. His hand involuntarily sought his back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
only to find that the quiver had been craftily taken from it.</p>

<p>Wide awake and full of alarm now he ran with all speed back
to the locality that King Stanislaus had designated for the reunion
of the band. But the half-hour had elapsed, and the
Brownies were not there.</p>

<p>Then he noticed in the sand prints of narrow, tapering feet
all leading down the beach, and he flew in the direction they
pointed. But when he reached the spot where the Policeman
had made his discovery the Brownies were not there,
either.</p>

<p>He felt convinced that they had started for Dragonfel&rsquo;s palace,
and he ran as fast as he could to overtake them, passing
the engine-house, and going over the bridge.</p>

<p>When he was approaching the palace he saw five persons
very small of stature, each with a big brass instrument, standing
just outside the entrance. The doors swung suddenly open,
they passed through them, and then the doors closed again.</p>

<p>Florimel quickened his pace with the determination to follow
them, but just when he was about to pound upon the doors
for admittance tiny but strong hands grasped him, and held
him back, and he heard the whispered warning:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, or you will ruin all!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="st">THE GERMAN BAND</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> the German band was announced
by the Demon Usher in
his queer, cackling voice Queen
Titania, Dame Drusilda, Violet,
and Daffodil happened to be
seated on the steps of the throne,
and all were feeling grumpy
and out-of-sorts. Dragonfel had
tried to prevail upon them to
play dominoes or parchesi, but they had no heart for any
game.</p>

<p>Grouthead, Wolfinger, Mandrake, Boundingbore, Snoutpimple,
and others of the enchanter&rsquo;s followers were present
and some of them looked distinctly bored. Snoutpimple was
even trying to repress a yawn. Things at the palace had been
rather slow since the abduction of Queen Titania and her party,
and nothing especially wicked had occurred.</p>

<p>When it was known, however, that a number of strolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
musicians were going to play for them, a thrill of genuine
pleasure ran through the whole assemblage. Titania and her
companions were glad, for they felt that some enlivening strains
would greatly cheer their drooping spirits. Dragonfel&rsquo;s followers
were equally delighted, though they did not care in the
least for music. But knowing their master as they did they
were very sure that the prospective concert would prove exceedingly
interesting.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i145.png" width="332" height="276" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>Escorted by
the smirking
Demon Usher,
who rubbed
his hands
together while
he cackled
joyously to
himself, and
who
half skipped,
half flew,
before them,
the members
of the German
band entered awkwardly, and clumsily arranged themselves
in a semi-circle before the throne.</p>

<p>There were five of them including the leader who stood at
the end nearest Dragonfel and the others&mdash;all diminutive,
moustached men with big noses, whose frayed, soiled uniforms
fitted them very badly indeed. Their trousers at the ends were
rolled up a number of times over, and their coats which hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
on them like bags actually reached almost to their shoe-tops.</p>

<p>Upon the chest of the one who stood next to the leader were
pinned a great variety of medals, and he seemed to be very
proud of them, since no one else boasted a decoration of any
kind.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i146.png" width="390" height="420" alt="The band" title="" />
</div>

<p>The little audience grouped about the throne gazed at them
expectantly, and Titania thought the leader winked at her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
But apparently he did not notice anyone, and least of all Dragonfel.
His whole attention seemed to be centred on his band.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are ve all here alretty?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; came in chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I vill broceed der gall der roll-gall. &lsquo;Louie
Knobloch!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I vass here,&rdquo; said the one with the medals next to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peter Dinkelspeil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I vass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hermann Sweinskopf!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s peen here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jacob Schnittger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bresend early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emil Muller!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no response, and all the rest turned and looked
at the leader in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emil Muller!&rdquo; he repeated, and then, suddenly recollecting
something, went on: &ldquo;Oh, oxguse me! I vass here.
Heinrich von Strauss! Heinrich von Strauss! Vere iss
Heiny von Strauss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He vass py his bedt sick,&rdquo; said Louie Knobloch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vat&rsquo;s der madder mit der bedt?&rdquo; demanded Emil Muller.
&ldquo;For vhy iss id sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nein, nein, keppelmeister,&rdquo; said Louie Knobloch. &ldquo;Id iss
Heiny vat iss sick. He iss sick by der inside off der bedt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vhy iss he sick?&rdquo; asked Emil Muller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yestertay,&rdquo; explained Louie Knobloch, &ldquo;he vend on der
bicnig, und he eated four dozen charlotte roosters, und he gets

<p>He illustrated his remarks by significantly rubbing his stomach.
&ldquo;He vas not in goot contition to plow ven ve left.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i147.png" width="431" height="309" alt="All raised their instruments" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Anyvone vot eadts charlotte roosters ought der be sick,&rdquo;
said Emil Muller decidedly. &ldquo;He shoult eat dem vhen dey iss
a egg. Blay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All raised their instruments to their mouths, but he held up
a warning finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anodder t&rsquo;ing,&rdquo; he went on to Knobloch. &ldquo;You dell Heinrich

him! Are you retty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Den plow yourselfs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then began a wild riot of discord, whereupon Emil Muller
quickly took his own dented offending cornet from his mouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ve vill nod blay dot biece,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Id iss no goot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vhy don&rsquo;d you wride some musigs, keppelmeister?&rdquo; suggested
Peter Dinkelspeil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I voult, bud I&rsquo;m doo pusy,&rdquo; said Emil Muller. &ldquo;Led us
renter insteadt dot peaudiful biece fon Vawgner, &lsquo;Der Glock on

<p>&ldquo;Vatch, keppelmeister,&rdquo; corrected Louie Knobloch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vatch vat?&rdquo; inquired Emil Muller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Id iss nod a glock,&rdquo; explained Louie Knobloch. &ldquo;Id iss a
vatch on der Rhine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A glock all gan see iss besser,&rdquo; said Emil Muller, and in the
midst of their second attempt Hermann Swinescopf raised his
hand and shouted in the effort to make himself heard above
the din:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shtob der pandt! Shtob der pandt! I am shbeaking!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vot&rsquo;s der madder?&rdquo; asked Emil Muller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vass iss der biece you say ve blay?&rdquo; questioned Hermann
Sweinskopf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say &lsquo;Der Glock on der Rhine&rsquo; fon Vawgner,&rdquo; replied Emil
Muller.</p>

<p>They started once more, but again came the vigorous interruption
from Hermann Sweinskopf:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shtob der pandt! Shtob der pandt! I am shbeaking!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vhy don&rsquo;d you shbeak your moud oud undt pe done mit
it?&rdquo; said Emil Muller angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vass iss dis here biece, &lsquo;Der Glock on der Rhine,&rsquo; anyhow?
Iss id a so-na-da?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yess&mdash;undt no!&rdquo; said Emil Muller, reflecting. &ldquo;Id iss a
in-u-en-do! Are you all retty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; they chorused, setting themselves in proper shape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, altogedder den, und show de vorld vot you can do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came a third attempt, but the leader again stopped
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who plew dot bum node?&rdquo; he sternly demanded. Everyone
looked at each other in surprise, and Louie Knobloch said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, I don&rsquo;d dood id.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;d did id,&rdquo; said Peter Dinkelspeil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;d done id,&rdquo; said Hermann Sweinskopf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;d did did id,&rdquo; said Jacob Schnittger.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i148.png" width="455" height="377" alt="Who plew dot bum node" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re de von,&rdquo; Emil Muller accused Louie Knobloch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
&ldquo;You plew dot bum node, no madder vot oxguse you make!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Louie Knobloch stoutly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;d dood id.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re de von,&rdquo; insisted Emil Muller. &ldquo;You plew dot
bum node, it vass near me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; denied Louie Knobloch. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;d plow no bum
nodes. I vass as goot a musiker as you pe, und maype vorse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dake dot bum node und bay yourself,&rdquo; said Emil Muller
reminded him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dot don&rsquo;d make some ice!&rdquo; said Louie Knobloch, accompanying
the words with sarcastic shakes of his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;d
see no medals on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked complacently down at his own chest and regarded
with satisfaction the big assortment there. Emil Muller was
evidently taken aback, but he recovered himself sufficiently to
say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am de leater, und you gan ged oudt off der pandt. Ve
gan ged along mitout you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, vell,&rdquo; said Louie Knobloch, &ldquo;I gan go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Den vhy don&rsquo;d you? Vat are you shtanding here for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I vass vaiding for my money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much do you owe me?&rdquo; asked Emil Muller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I owe you a veek&rsquo;s vages,&rdquo; said Louie Knobloch. &ldquo;No, you
owe me a veek&rsquo;s vages. You bay me my money und I go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dake dot bum node und bay yourself,&rdquo; said Muller.</p>

<p>That settled the controversy, and Louis Knobloch made no
effort to go, nor did Emil Muller urge him.</p>

<p>They made another attempt, without any further interruption,
and, while their cheeks puffed out, and they got red in
their faces, no one could tell what tune they were playing.</p>

<p>Dragonfel from the throne silently motioned to Grouthead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
who went out, and returned a few seconds later with a tray
on which were four tiny glasses of ginger ale.</p>

<div class="i149">

<p>Jacob Schnittger turned and saw him, and then rushed to
help himself to one of the glasses of ginger ale. A moment
later Hermann Sweinskopf followed his example, and then
Peter Dinkelspeil. Louie Knobloch suddenly noticed his companions
preparing to refresh themselves, and made a frantic
dash to join them. That left only Emil Muller,
the leader, playing. He looked around to find out
what was
the matter,
and then
sprinted
toward
Grouthead,
but there
was no
ginger ale
left on the
tray. He
stood with
ill-concealed envy watching the other four who were clinking
their glasses hilariously. Then the quartet began to sing:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Halli, hallo, halli, hallo;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Halli, hallo, halli, hallo,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bei uns geht&rsquo;s immer noch so!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Prosit, leater!&rdquo; said Louie Knobloch mockingly, as he lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
his glass, with the other three facing around and following suit.</p>

<p>Emil Muller was speechless. He kicked his heels together
as he watched them drinking and smacking their lips. Dragonfel
again signalled to Grouthead who went out, and came
back bearing an immense glass of ginger ale upon the tray.</p>

<p>Emil Muller swooped
down upon it
exultingly, and
with great difficulty
held it
aloft. The others
of the band gathered
around in
awe, while
Louie Knobloch stood on tiptoe to obtain a better view of the
glass. Emil Muller blew the froth into Louie&rsquo;s face, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
latter wiped it off with his fingers, afterwards putting them
in his mouth, as though even small favors sometimes count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know vot dot man Vilhelm Shake-a-sbeare vonct

</div>

<div class="figleft">

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Louie Knobloch,
wiping the froth from
his eyes. &ldquo;Vot dit he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emil Muller raised the glass
to his lips, remarking with
great emphasis:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shake-a-sbeare vonct saidt,

<p>But before he could partake
of the cooling drink all of a
sudden the Red Spirit with the
bow and quiver of arrows he
had taken surreptitiously from
Prince Florimel flew through
the window into the room,
shattering the glass all to
pieces, and lit right at Dragonfel&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be not deceived, kind master!&rdquo; he cried, in great excitement.
&ldquo;They are the Brownies!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="left r8">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="st">THE EARTHQUAKE<br />
AND VOLCANO</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> big glass with not so much as
a single drop tasted by Emil Muller&rsquo;s
lips fell from his hand with
a loud crash, and its contents
flowed like an amber-colored river
along the floor.</p>

<p>Almost instantly at the Red
Spirit&rsquo;s startling announcement
Dragonfel had sprung up from his
throne stiff and rigid, and was regarding
the embryo musicians with
a glare of peculiar malevolence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Brownies!&rdquo; he involuntarily ejaculated. &ldquo;I thought
they played too well for a German band!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Queen Titania, Dame Drusilda, Violet, and Daffodil had
also risen as though they had received an electric shock. Their
breath came fast in their sudden agitation. They started to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
go to the musicians, but Wolfinger, Mandrake, and Snoutpimple
roughly grasped them, and held them back.</p>

<p>Realizing the failure of a deception that might have achieved
success had it not been for the sly spying of the malicious Red
Spirit, Emil Muller, otherwise King Stanislaus, turned and
faced Dragonfel, his very attitude hurling a strong challenge
of defiance.</p>

<p>Knowing that further subterfuge would be useless, the
doughty monarch in a flash whisked off his false nose and
moustache, and slipped from his baggy clothes. Likewise
Louie Knobloch, Peter Dinkelspeil, Hermann Sweinskopf, and
Jacob Schnittger removed their disguises, and the unmistakable
features of the Sailor, Policeman, German, and Irishman
were revealed. &ldquo;Yes, we are the Brownies,&rdquo; cried King
Stanislaus, &ldquo;come to demand the instant surrender of Queen
Titania and her companions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Idiots!&rdquo; snarled Dragonfel, in a fury. &ldquo;You have rushed
to your destruction!&rdquo; And he clapped his hands together, and
shouted to his followers around him: &ldquo;What ho, there!
Summon everyone in the palace! We&rsquo;ll see that these presumptuous
sprites meet with fitting punishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Demon Usher half flew, and half ran, with even more
celerity than usual, to do his bidding. With teeth showing, and
fists clenched, the infuriated enchanter advanced threateningly
toward the intrepid members of the band who looked at him
without even so much as flinching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a care!&rdquo; warned King Stanislaus. &ldquo;Beware of the
Brownies&rsquo; mystic power!&rdquo; And, turning to the Sailor, he
added: &ldquo;Quick! the signal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly the Sailor blew a deafening blast upon his cornet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and in a trice there was the pounding of many fists upon the
outer doors, with crashing sounds as though heavy logs were
being directed with the force of many hands against them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i153.png" width="448" height="452" alt="He clapped his hands together" title="" />
</div>

<p>Under the fierce, determined assault the doors gave way and
toppled in, while through the opening swarmed and crowded
the band of eager Brownies, with Prince Florimel in their lead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>At almost the same instant, through other doors, poured
Dragonfel&rsquo;s hosts, with Vulcan&rsquo;s red imps somersaulting and
leaping among them, and there were so many of them, and all
so big and powerful, they well might cause dismay to the
stoutest heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So be it then!&rdquo; cried Dragonfel, grandiloquently, for the
sight of all these great, hulking fellows gave him renewed confidence.
&ldquo;It is power against power!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, striking a pompous attitude, he cleared his throat, and
placed his hand on his chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand back!&rdquo; shouted King Stanislaus. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to
speak a piece!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Dragonfel poetically spouted:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Much rather than in spite of me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The union of these bands should be,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Come crumbling down in lime and sand!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This incantation, punctuated, as it were, by Vulcan&rsquo;s imps,
who threw balls of fire into the air where the commas, semicolon,
and exclamation point are above transcribed, was delivered
with only fair elocutionary ability, but its effect was
electrifying.</p>

<p>Almost with the last word uttered by his vindictive lips a
tremor ran through the earth that brought to all a sickening
sensation of fear. The heavy walls and ornate supporting pillars
shook, tottered, and then fell with a terrific crash, that
might well horrify all, as the vibrations of the earth continued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>In another instant the magnificent palace lay in ruins illumined
by fierce flames that leaped wildly from the apex of the
volcano and licked with fiery tongues the very sky.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i154.png" width="457" height="433" alt="Ruins" title="" />
</div>

<p>Shrieking and screaming with the horror of it all Dragonfel&rsquo;s
followers and the Brownies alike ran hither and thither,
their warfare temporarily forgotten in this more appalling danger
that suddenly had come to them. In their fright some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
sought ridiculous places of refuge but it was a matter of speed.</p>

<p>True to their nature to help in all times of distress, the
Brownies worked well to save things from complete ruin, and
if the proper implements had been at hand the havoc would not
have been so severe. But Vulcan was in no mood to quit the
quake that was felt in all parts of the palace.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i155.png" width="391" height="287" alt="The State bed-chamber" title="" />
</div>

<p>Even the State bed-chamber was not exempt, and things that
had gone up with great care and cost came down with great
crash and confusion.</p>

<p>But more terrible danger menaced them. The shock of the
earthquake was over, and had wrought utter ruin. Still, as
far as could be learned, in all the confusion, uproar, and wild
excitement no lives had been lost. Far greater peril, however,
threatened from which there did not seem to be a possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
way of escape, new horrors faced them on every side.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i156.png" width="328" height="235" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>Round and pear-shaped volcanic bombs shot up with tremendous
velocity from the crater&rsquo;s boiling mouth, formed from
the precious minerals stored for centuries deep in the treasury
of the earth. And all of these in a molten red-hot liquid mass
were flowing
swiftly and irresistibly
in a
bubbling, hissing,
steaming,
seething, blood-red
river
straight on to
where the unfortunate
Brownies
were among
the ruins of
the once proud and haughty palace.</p>

<p>Before all this occurred Florimel&rsquo;s quick eye had noticed the
audacious Red Spirit with his stolen bow and arrows, and he
had sprung forward to wrest them from him. But the strange,
repulsive creature evaded him mockingly, and flew off with
his booty.</p>

<p>The disappointment of the prince was transformed to delight
when the next moment he beheld Titania running to him with
arms extended. But they never met, for before she could reach
his side the terrible catastrophe of the earthquake and volcano
happened, and they were jostled and crowded apart by the
throng, who in their great terror seemed to have lost all control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of their senses.
In all the turmoil
careful watch was
kept of the captives.
Nearer and nearer
came the molten
stream of lava, and
hotter and hotter
grew its scorching
breath, while huge
trees in its remorseless
path flared up
and shriveled away
in an instant.</p>

<p>When the stunning
shock to his nerves
was exhausting itself,
King Stanislaus
in a dazed way
began to think, with
the full realization
that whatever there
was to be done had
to be accomplished quickly.</p>

<p>Suddenly he recalled the frame building they had passed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
going to the palace. If it housed as he most fervently hoped
it did a complete equipment for fighting fires it might prove the
very means by which the Brownies could grapple with a situation
that was becoming more and more intolerable.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i158.png" width="455" height="294" alt="Escape" title="" />
</div>

<p>Promptly he communicated his plan to various members of
the band, as he spied them, and the word was passed around
from one to the other, until all were fully conversant with His
Majesty&rsquo;s views. And very soon all these agile sprites, with
King Stanislaus and Prince Florimel in the lead, were racing
helter-skelter back to the wooden structure that bore the inscription:
<span class="lower">NEPTUNE HOOK AND LADDER CO. NO. 1.</span></p>

<p>They broke in the doors, and soon were prying into every
nook and corner of the place. And, while King Stanislaus
forthwith seized a fire-trumpet that was hanging from a hook
on the wall, Brownies were donning with the greatest haste fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
helmets that even with paper stuffed in them came down over
their ears, and putting on rubber boots and coats intended by
Dragonfel for his followers, and which proved but sorry fits,
for the boots came well up over their waists, and had to be
turned back, and the coats trailed after them like the long
trains of fashionable ladies&rsquo; gowns.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i159.png" width="448" height="330" alt="Antiquated" title="" />
</div>

<p>The energetic monarch was rather disappointed to find upon
inspection that the machine instead of being one of the modern,
up-to-date kind was of a very antiquated type, a brake-engine
with man-handles that had to be worked by hand to throw a
stream of water. But he was greatly relieved to discover that
there was an abundant supply of hose, for in providing himself
with this the enchanter evidently had made a nice calculation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the distance from the crater of the volcano to the stand-pipe
connection in the palace, and he had allowed plenty to spare.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i160.png" width="451" height="419" alt="The hose-carriage" title="" />
</div>

<p>In stentorian tones His Majesty shouted out his orders
through the fire-trumpet, and the Brownies hauled out the engine
and hose-carriage. Then they all took hold of the long
ropes attached to them, and started on a run for Dragonfel&rsquo;s
ruined palace, that now was little more than a tumbled heap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Brownies perched on the engine, and one kept clanging the
bell furiously. Some who ran with the ropes tripped on the
trailing tails of their rubber coats, but they never let go, and
were dragged along by their surer-footed companions.</p>

<p>After they had gone some distance the Policeman began
shouting in remonstrance, and King Stanislaus ordered a halt
to hear what he had to say. &ldquo;What is it, officer?&rdquo; asked His
Majesty. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go back,&rdquo; panted the Policeman.
&ldquo;Some of us forgot to put on red shirts.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i161.png" width="253" height="115" alt="Caught" title="" />
</div>

<p>Though King Stanislaus felt very much chagrined at such
neglect, he realized that it was now too late to remedy this most
important matter, for every passing moment was precious. So
he bellowed through the
trumpet instructions to
continue, and pulling and
straining at the ropes they
flew on, with the engine
and hose-carriage bumping,
lurching, and swaying
after them.</p>

<p>On and on they went, pit-patting at last across the rickety
old wooden bridge, but before they could drag the engine across
it one of the planks snapped in two under its weight, and the
wheels on one side went down through the opening almost as far
as the water below.</p>

<p>The engine was firmly stuck, and though the Brownies tugged
and strained at the rope, puffing, panting, and exerting all their
strength, they could not even so much as budge it.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the terrible river of fire, and the
volcano seemed to be reaching even greater activity. It looked
as though this effort of the Brownies was in vain.</p>

<h2 class="left r8">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="st">THE BROWNIES FIGHT<br />
THE FLAMES</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">But</span> once more the indomitable spirit
of King Stanislaus manifested itself.
Though the fire-engine was jammed
in between the joists and timbers of
the bridge, and could not be extracted
by pulling the rope, the plucky monarch
would not allow himself to be vanquished
without a struggle.</p>

<p>He caused the Brownies to bring heavy planks, and farther
directed them to wrench off the guard-rails of the bridge. The
ends of these were placed under the engine, while at those opposite
the sprites exerted as powerful a leverage as they could
at the same time comrades were pulling with all their might
and main at the rope.</p>

<p>Finally their combined efforts resulted in raising the engine
up on the bridge again, after which it was easily rolled upon the
road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>This unfortunate delay had seemed much longer than it really
was, owing to the exigency of the situation, but they made up
for lost time during the rest of the distance, and reached the
site of the ruins without further mishap.</p>

<div class="i163">

<p>The lava was almost upon them, and they were nearly suffocated
by the intense heat. But, while
King Stanislaus ran here and there
directing the preparations, and shouting
his orders through the fire-trumpet,
they quickly unwound the coils of hose and effected
a connection with the stand-pipe.</p>

<p>The water was thereupon turned on, and while Brownies in
helmets, rubber coats, and boots held grimly on to the hose and
trained the big brass nozzle on the fast approaching lava, others
manned the handles of the engine, a half dozen or more being
required at each end, and flew hanging to them up and down
through the air to furnish the necessary pressure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i164.png" width="447" height="504" alt="The fire-engine" title="" />
</div>

<p>Though the engine was old and out of repair, it had one redeeming
feature. It could throw two or three streams of water
at once as well as one, and the Brownies in their great need
forced it to the limit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i165.png" width="301" height="256" alt="The hose burst" title="" />
</div>

<p>Immense volumes of water gushed out at the lava, and their
contact produced a hissing, boiling sound, while the air was
almost immediately filled with steam which became so thick
that it could almost
be cut with
a knife. In the
thick vapors that
arose their forms
could only be distinguished
dimly,
and they seemed
like shadows flitting
to and fro.</p>

<p>At times the
hose burst in various
places, and
streams of water
from them spouted
high into the air involving waste, but King Stanislaus proved
himself equal to all emergencies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stick your fingers in the holes to keep the water in,&rdquo; he
shouted through the trumpet.</p>

<p>Brownies either poked their fingers through the openings
or held their hands against them to prevent the escape of water.
The hose got away from those who were holding it, and the
terrific stream drenched the Dude, Chinaman, and Indian who
were directly in its path, sweeping them off their feet. In
another moment the Brownies regained their mastery of it,
and once more the water was directed full at the blazing
lava.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Such efforts were bound to achieve results, and these King
Stanislaus noted with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gaining on it!&rdquo; he announced exultantly. &ldquo;Just
keep it up, boys, and we&rsquo;ll soon have the fire out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, higher and higher flew the Brownies on
the handles of the engine, while others continued to play the
hose upon the descending lava, which hissed, steamed, and
bubbled as the water struck it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i166.png" width="460" height="229" alt="With buckets" title="" />
</div>

<p>As the lava cooled off it formed a composition resembling
asphalt, and upon this the Brownies could walk, unwinding as
they did so more and more hose, and all the while getting nearer
and nearer to the volcano.</p>

<p>Finally they were directing the stream down the crater&rsquo;s
mouth, which gurgled, gasped, and then instead of flame began
to emit smoldering smoke which grew less and less in
volume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess that settles Mr. Volcano!&rdquo; triumphantly cried King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Stanislaus, as he wiped beads of perspiration from his royal
brow.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i167.png" width="455" height="459" alt="The vulcano" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity the palace was destroyed,&rdquo; remarked the Student.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dragonfel&rsquo;s own fault,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;and he has
only himself to blame. I wouldn&rsquo;t have that man&rsquo;s mean disposition,
no, not for all the jewels and mines he possesses.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if he has lost his palace,&rdquo; said the Dude, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got
a fine new macadamized road to the volcano. With a jitney-bus
he can make a lot of money from tourists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fire was practically extinguished, and all danger from it
had passed. It was well that this was so, for the first rays
of the sun were beginning to appear in the brightening east,
and the mystic powers of the Brownies which come at night
were fast being exhausted.</p>

<p>When the valiant fire-fighters at last had the volcano under
control, Prince Florimel gazed anxiously around for Queen
Titania, Dame Drusilda, Violet, and Daffodil, but none of them
was in sight.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i168.png" width="331" height="246" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>Neither
could he observe
Dragonfel
nor any of
his followers,
for when they
had become
assured of
safety these
cravens had
fled, leaving
the Brownies
to do all the work.</p>

<p>Florimel ran hither and thither, searching among the ruins
for those he was so eager to find, and calling aloud their names,
but there was no response to his cries, nor could he discover
the slightest trace of them anywhere, which alarmed him
greatly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The Brownies were taking a much needed rest, but he got
them all to join in the quest, and they hunted in every nook
and corner thereabout without success.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i169.png" width="344" height="262" alt="Searching" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;This is indeed strange,&rdquo; said King Stanislaus, very much
puzzled. &ldquo;They were here just a little while ago, for I saw
them myself. I didn&rsquo;t pay any particular attention to them
at the time, for the volcano was keeping me pretty busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have made their escape,&rdquo; said Florimel, &ldquo;and have
again carried off the queen and her companions. The question
is, where have they gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think they have gone far,&rdquo; said the king, and his
eye swept the harbor where the galleon was plainly visible.
&ldquo;Perhaps they are on the ship, but I very much doubt it. It
may be they are hiding somewhere near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly the Policeman who was still prowling stealthily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
around poked his club in a dark, out-of-the-way corner into
something flabby which at once emitted a queer, cackling shriek
so uncanny that everyone jumped back in fright.</p>

<p>The next moment he quickly reached in his arm and drew
out by the ear the quaking, shaking Demon Usher who had
no opportunity to practice his eccentric locomotion, but was
obliged to crawl after his captor on his hands and knees.</p>

<p>The Policeman led him by the ear to King Stanislaus who
eyed him sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy, have mercy!&rdquo; shrieked the Demon Usher, in abject
terror, and he shook as though he had the dumb ague, chills
and fever, and something else besides. &ldquo;Oh, kind sir, I will
be your slave for life, and obey your slightest wish. Only
don&rsquo;t kill or torture me, I beg you!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i170.png" width="302" height="235" alt="Found" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the truth, or it will be the worse for you,&rdquo; said King
Stanislaus.</p>

<p>His words in no sense were a threat, for it is always the
worse for anyone who does not tell the truth. But they only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
served to increase the fears of the poor, frightened wretch
who shook as if he had added St. Vitus dance to all his other
symptoms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spare my life!&rdquo; he whined, with his teeth clicking against
each other like castenets. &ldquo;Oh, please, sir, spare my life!
Ask me anything you like, and I will answer you. Yes, and
though it is very hard for me to do so, I will speak the truth.
Let me be your slave, and fan you, and black your boots!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know that already. Where has he gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Demon Usher looked around timidly as though to assure
himself that neither Dragonfel nor any of his followers was
within hearing, and then said, with an air of great cunning:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I tell you, will you let me go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said King Stanislaus. &ldquo;I give you my promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will tell you,&rdquo; said the Demon Usher. &ldquo;He has
flown with his captives to his mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His mine?&rdquo; echoed His Majesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you not heard of it?&rdquo; asked the Demon Usher in
great surprise. &ldquo;Why, it is the most wonderful mine in all the
world. Every jewel known to a lapidary is there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Near by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead us to it,&rdquo; broke in Florimel eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said the Demon Usher. &ldquo;I will show you
the secret passage-way through which Dragonfel and the rest
entered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Florimel made an impatient start to be off, and the Brownies
showed their willingness to follow him through all dangers, but
King Stanislaus, more careful, raised his hand to call a halt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;This may only be a ruse to trap us.
How do we know this is the truth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the truth,&rdquo; averred the Demon Usher. &ldquo;Follow me
and I will soon prove it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He moved off with his queer half-skip and half-jump, cocking
his eye behind at them as if he feared they would try to stop
him. But no one made any attempt to do so, and he appeared
very much relieved.</p>

<p>Close at his heels came Florimel and the Brownies, with
King Stanislaus among them, but the monarch looked ill at ease,
as though he suspected treachery of some kind.</p>

<p>The Demon Usher led them to a slight rise where there was a
rocky formation, and stopped before a boulder so huge that it
would have required the strength of many men to move it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i171.png" width="453" height="252" alt="He moved off" title="" />
</div>

<p>Searching with his long, thin fingers for a certain place, he
found it at length, and pressed against it as hard as he could.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i172.png" width="254" height="323" alt="Tricked" title="" />
</div>

<p>To the surprise of all the rest, the boulder began to slide
easily away, disclosing the entrance to a dark, subterranean
passage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow the passage,&rdquo;
cried the Demon Usher
triumphantly, &ldquo;and it will
lead you to Dragonfel and
his captives!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Florimel and the
Brownies at once entered,
and King Stanislaus ran
after them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; came his warning.
&ldquo;Before we go any
farther let us first consider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when they were all
inside it suddenly grew
pitch-black, as the boulder
quickly slid back into
its place.</p>

<p>From outside they heard the Demon Usher give a hoarse
cackle of exultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tricked!&rdquo; ejaculated King Stanislaus. &ldquo;We are caught
like rats in a trap!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="left">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="st">THE FLIGHT TO<br />
THE MINE</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> bringing about the destruction of his
palace Dragonfel&rsquo;s only thought had
been the destruction of the Brownies.
He had hoped to crush the
sprites by means of the falling
walls and columns, and when he
invoked Vulcan for the assistance
he felt sure would be given to him
he was very careful to keep out
of harm&rsquo;s way himself.</p>

<p>But like many another vindictive,
revengeful person the
wicked enchanter overreached
himself. He had no idea when he called upon Vulcan to get
busy that the latter would make such a good job of it.</p>

<p>He fully expected the palace to topple down, for that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
what he had asked for. But he did not want the volcano that
had been thrown in for good measure. It made things too hot
and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>He was very much alarmed when he saw the volcano in violent
eruption, for he realized that the downpour of lava boded
ill for himself as well as for others over whose safety he was
not at all concerned.</p>
</div>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i174.png" width="305" height="255" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>Thinking only
of himself, he
was on the point
of ordering out
his volunteer fire
department to
subdue the flames
in the crater
when to his great
relief he noticed
that King Stanislaus
had taken the
matter out of his
hands.</p>

<p>From his place
of safety Dragonfel watched the operations of the Brownies,
and he breathed more freely when he noticed that they were
getting the fire well under control, so that the prospect of
all danger was fast being removed through their energetic
efforts.</p>

<p>He realized that after the volcano was subdued these indomitable
little people would devote their attention to him, and
in considering what the outcome would be he grew more and
more uncertain. As a matter of fact, he was beginning to fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the mystic power of the Brownies, and he very much doubted
if his big followers with all their boasted strength were a fit
match for these sprites who had not only cunning but courage.</p>

<p>He decided that in the clash which was bound to come it was
best not to risk any chance of defeat in a fair, open fight, but
by underhanded means to overpower them.</p>

<p>Then the diabolical scheme of making the Brownies prisoners,
and setting them to work in his mine, presented itself. If he
fled there with his captives, they would undoubtedly follow in
pursuit, and once in the mine they easily could be made helpless.</p>

<p>The Demon Usher at his feet was going through all sorts of
contortions of fear, and Dragonfel looked sneeringly down at
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop your shaking, and listen to me,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;We
are going to take the captives to the mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us start at once, kind master,&rdquo; said the Demon Usher,
in a fever of impatience. &ldquo;If it gets cool here it will be too
hot to hold us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be the only one to stay,&rdquo; said Dragonfel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, say not so, kind master!&rdquo; cried the Demon Usher, shaking
with even greater violence than before. &ldquo;If they catch me
they will kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it will be good riddance to bad rubbish,&rdquo; was Dragonfel&rsquo;s
unfeeling retort. &ldquo;I said you were to stay, so that settles
it. When the Brownies ask you where we&rsquo;ve gone, you&rsquo;re to
tell them to the mine. They&rsquo;ll probably make you lead them to
it. When they do take them to the secret entrance, and after
they are in close the boulder on them. Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I grasp you perfectly,&rdquo; said the Demon Usher, &ldquo;but,
oh, kind master, I have a weak heart, and at times it fails me.
Would it not be better to intrust a delicate matter like this to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Snoutpimple?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After they are imprisoned,&rdquo;
went on Dragonfel,
unheeding
the suggestion,
&ldquo;you can come around by the main entrance, and let me
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as soon as he was fully convinced that all danger was
over the enchanter passed the word around among his followers
to decamp, and this was effected so insidiously that the Brownies
did not notice it.</p>

<p>They laid rough hands on Queen Titania, Dame Drusilda,
Violet, and Daffodil, muffling the cries for help they tried to
make, and bore them with great haste from the scene of excitement;
the waving arms and kicking availed them nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>With their struggling, protesting
burdens in their arms
they ran toward the mine,
and descended into it
by the main entrance.
When they reached the
great shaft where the
mine-sprites were hard
at work, Titania, Dame
Drusilda, Violet, and
Daffodil were released,
and they looked around
with wonder and surprise.</p>

<p>The mine-sprites cast furtive glances of curiosity at these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
strange new faces that invited confidence, but so frightened
were they when they saw their cruel master that they redoubled
their efforts, and their fingers fairly flew as they dug them in
the earth for precious stones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little things!&rdquo; was Queen Titania&rsquo;s involuntary cry.
&ldquo;The work is too hard for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking of that,&rdquo; said Dragonfel, with a chuckle,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve decided to put an extra force on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to set us to work?&rdquo; asked Dame Drusilda indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Dragonfel, with a horrid grin. &ldquo;Just now,
though, I&rsquo;m going to take you all to another part of the mine
where we&rsquo;ll await developments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke he seized Titania&rsquo;s hand, and began to drag her
off down one of the dark passage-ways. In the same manner
Mandrake followed with Dame Drusilda, while after him came
Boundingbore with Violet and Daffodil.</p>

<p>The mine-sprites watched their retreating forms, but they
were too terrified to speak a word, and were helpless to aid
them in any way.</p>

<p>Dragonfel led the rest along the subterranean passage until
at last they came to a square chamber that had been cut with
much skill into the solid rock.</p>

<p>When Mandrake lit a crystal lamp the great magnificence of
the place was revealed.</p>

<p>The floor and walls were inlaid with precious jewels in designs
that were truly wonderful. Divans were built in at the
sides, and the various creatures of the wild were represented
everywhere.</p>

<p>For all his short-comings, Dragonfel seemed to have a great
respect for animals, and gave their skins at least a rest on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
floors and walls where they could grin at spiders and moth-millers
with some show of satisfaction.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i177.png" width="442" height="410" alt="Creatures of the wild" title="" />
</div>

<p>At the ceiling which was thickly crusted with diamonds there
was a slender open shaft that evidently had been made to provide
air and light but which was too small to provide a means
of escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is where you&rsquo;ll stay,&rdquo; announced Dragonfel. &ldquo;The
place isn&rsquo;t half-bad, as things go, so you ought to make yourselves
fairly comfortable in it. You&rsquo;ll find both hot and cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
water in the little ante-room screened off by those peacock-feather
portières. Your meals will be brought to you. If you
want to read there&rsquo;s the dictionary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long are you going to keep us here?&rdquo; asked Titania,
with a sinking of her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always, and maybe longer,&rdquo; was Dragonfel&rsquo;s gruff response.
&ldquo;Have you brought your knitting with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think you can keep us here against our will,&rdquo; said
Titania, in a decided tone, &ldquo;you will find that you are very
much mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; said Dragonfel contemptuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long before the Brownies are here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I fully expect,&rdquo; said the enchanter, with a
knowing wink, &ldquo;and after they come there&rsquo;ll be something doing,
<span class="smcap">believe me</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laid great emphasis upon the last two words, and in spite
of all her confidence in Florimel and the Brownies Titania was
filled with great uneasiness.</p>

<p>But she knew that further words would be wasted on him,
so she said nothing more. With Dame Drusilda, Violet, and
Daffodil she retired to a corner of the room, as far removed
from him as possible, where they discussed among themselves
in whispers this new phase of the disagreeable situation.</p>

<p>They hoped that Dragonfel and the rest would go, but still
they lingered, and the enchanter at times looked up at the narrow
opening cut into the ceiling. Finally he gave expression
to a grunt of satisfaction as something he had been watching
for met his gaze, and they noticed with him that a golden flood
of sunshine was pouring through the opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Day at last!&rdquo; he cried, and, almost with his words, the
Demon Usher made his appearance with a hop, skip, and jump,
while at his back stood a half-starved looking demon whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
hair had not been cut for a long time, and who had a distinctly
artistic appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master, kind master,&rdquo; the Demon Usher joyously cackled,
&ldquo;I bear good news. The little commission you intrusted me
with I executed to the best of my ability. Oh, master, you
should have seen how brave I was. I was with them single-handed,
yet I was more than a match for them all. I had the
whole band in terrible fear of me.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i178.png" width="451" height="369" alt="The Demon Usher" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Stop throwing bouquets at yourself!&rdquo; ordered Dragonfel.
&ldquo;Tell me where they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all easy now,&rdquo; went on the Demon Usher. &ldquo;The dangerous
part has been done by me. I&rsquo;ve got them so cowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
that now they&rsquo;ll eat out of your hand. I captured them all
by myself, and drove them into the south lode, where they wait
to do your bidding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you permit me a word, kind master?&rdquo; then spoke up
the half-starved looking demon, as he unrolled a large sheet of
paper. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t deserve a medal, or even honorable mention.
I took a rough sketch of him when he had the Brownies
at his mercy, and here it is.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i179.png" width="401" height="316" alt="Permit me a word" title="" />
</div>

<p>Dragonfel stared at the effort in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have missed your calling,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;You should
be in the Academy of Design.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Titania had listened with fast increasing alarm, and
now with Dame Drusilda, Violet, and Daffodil she advanced
quickly toward him. &ldquo;Of whom is this creature speaking?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
she asked, in evident distress. &ldquo;Of the Brownies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Demon Usher uttered his disagreeable cackle as Dragonfel
exultingly responded:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i180.png" width="309" height="267" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Brownies! They are prisoners like yourselves.
Their nights of adventure are over, and they&rsquo;ll never more delight
in harmless pranks and helpful deeds. Those who seek
their aid will henceforth look for them in vain. They are
doomed to slave in this mine for the rest of their lives!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Grouthead came up running, and he cried in great excitement:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master, kind master, we have captured all the Brownies,
and they are helpless. What shall we do with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Set them to work at once,&rdquo; spoke Dragonfel. &ldquo;I will go
back with you to gloat over them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started immediately, and Titania and her companions
attempted to follow, but Mandrake barred the way, and held
them back.</p>

<h2 class="left r10">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="st">THE MISSION OF<br />
THE DOVE</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper1">After</span> the huge boulder had shut
in the unsuspecting Brownies
their only alternative was
to follow the winding passage-way
of the mine wherever
it might take them.
They could not remain where
they were to perish miserably of hunger and thirst, so they
crept cautiously along in the dark with the faint hope that in
some way they might gain the open. But the passage they
were forced to travel led them direct to the main-shaft where
the mine-sprites were at work. Nearly all of Dragonfel&rsquo;s followers
were there waiting to receive them. For the Demon
Usher after imprisoning them had descended by the main entrance
and gleefully imparted the news, claiming high honors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Sheepishly the Brownies slunk in, with the Dude&rsquo;s white
handkerchief fluttering at the end of his cane in token of the
band&rsquo;s complete surrender, for King Stanislaus knew how useless
it would be to offer any resistance.</p>

<p>They were all huddled together in a body, and a sorry, crestfallen
lot they were. Never before had such great misfortune
overtaken them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i182.png" width="452" height="318" alt="Discourse on Liberty" title="" />
</div>

<p>At times the Student Brownie would discourse on Liberty,
Justice, or Good Fellowship, and find appreciative listeners, and
he lifted up their hearts by assuring them that history repeats
itself, and that they would yet enjoy the freedom of the comets
and wandering stars.</p>

<p>While others of Dragonfel&rsquo;s followers guarded the Brownies
so that they could not escape, and brandished sharp-pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
spikes, battle-axes, bludgeons, and other formidable-looking
weapons significantly, Grouthead ran in hot haste to inform his
master.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i183.png" width="360" height="271" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>Soon the
wicked
enchanter
made his
appearance,
and his
rubicund
face
showed
high elation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put &rsquo;em
all to
work!&rdquo; he
shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em stand here idle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; asked King Stanislaus
meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, stop your talking, and get busy!&rdquo; cried Snoutpimple,
thrusting in the king&rsquo;s hand a pick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any choice,&rdquo; said His Majesty, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ll have to
take my pick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The airy persiflage was lost upon Dragonfel, who frowned
on him severely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a king in my own right,&rdquo; continued the monarch, pointing
to his crown, &ldquo;and never used a pick except to bury a dead
dog, but I&rsquo;ll not make a scene in the presence of my subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
so here goes for the jewels.&rdquo; His cheerfulness told on others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it was digging shedder-crabs or scallops,&rdquo; remarked the
Sailor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d soon fill a basket.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i184.png" width="461" height="431" alt="I never used a pick" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve broken stones before,&rdquo; said the Irishman, &ldquo;but this is
the first chance I ever had to get a whack at diamonds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell,&rdquo; said the German Brownie, &ldquo;if I see somedings in dot
blace shining like blitzen I bulls him oudt alretty yed und say
noddings!&rdquo; They were then hustled off to their new tasks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i185.png" width="228" height="251" alt="Guardian" title="" />
</div>

<p>With the mine-sprites and Brownies the king started to dig
away, and he tried not to shirk, but to do his stint with the
rest of them. The sight of
royalty reduced to hard labor
affected all his subjects
greatly, though they had
little opportunity for sympathy
so severely did their taskmasters
press them.</p>

<p>The heaps of precious
stones piled up higher and
higher, and their eyes fairly
blinked at the sight of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw so many
jewels before in all my life,&rdquo;
declared His Majesty, wincing
as he felt a sudden crick in his back. &ldquo;Whenever I look
at them I feel just as though I were going to break out with
carbuncles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder when they&rsquo;ll bring us something to eat,&rdquo; said
Florimel, who was beginning to grow hungry.</p>

<p>He was very much relieved when some time later Boundingbore
appeared with a cauldron of lukewarm soup, which was
served in skimpy little plates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, take mine back,&rdquo; complained King Stanislaus. &ldquo;Look
what&rsquo;s in it! Just imagine what would have happened to me
if I had swallowed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke he held up a pin which he had found in his soup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have hurt you, Your Majesty,&rdquo; said the Policeman.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a safety pin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now and then some adventurous Brownies would discover a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
new dark passage, and with
the hope that it might lead
to liberty the more
progressive would
get their heads together and plan a break for freedom.</p>

<p>For a time it looked as though one of these attempts would
be crowned with success, and liberty itself seemed to beckon in
the offing. But, just as promising enterprises in our own uncertain
careers often end in disappointment, so would each noble
effort only result in a punishment of heavier burdens and
shorter rations.</p>

<p>Mandrake with a tray of food went down one of the dark
passages, and soon returned empty-handed. This Florimel
noted, and he said to King Stanislaus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty, Titania and her companions must be over
there. I am going to try to find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took from the Sailor, who had charge of it, Euphrosyne&rsquo;s
dove, and, opening the bosom of his jacket, let it cuddle close
against his breast, with just its head now and then showing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>At a moment when the attention of all Dragonfel&rsquo;s followers
was temporarily diverted by some remarkable discovery he
made a sudden dash down the passage where he believed Queen
Titania and the others were imprisoned.</p>

<p>His companions grouped themselves together to screen
his fleeing form as best they could, and he succeeded in
getting away without detection.</p>
</div>

<div class="i187">

<p>Florimel ran along the passage,
and his supernatural vision
guided him. So when he came
to a gem-crusted door he was
able to see stretched before it
a form that he at once recognized as the Red Spirit.</p>

<p>The lazy fellow had been left to guard the prisoners, but
had neglected his duty, and was fast asleep.</p>

<p>Florimel heard him snoring away so that he knew his slumber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
was a heavy one, and he tiptoed up to him with confidence.</p>

<p>He was rejoiced to see lying beside him the bow and four
arrows, and he noiselessly reached for the bow, and restored
the arrows to his quiver.</p>

<p>Then he turned the big diamond that served as a knob for
the door, and stepping cautiously over the unconscious Red
Spirit, entered.</p>

<p>Titania, Dame Drusilda, Violet, and Daffodil were seated
upon one of the divans, and they sprang up joyously when they
saw him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Florimel!&rdquo; cried Titania, and ran toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Sh!&rdquo; he warned, and closed the door softly after him.
&ldquo;The Red Spirit is supposed to be guarding you, but he has
fallen asleep. We must be careful not to wake him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They embraced fondly, and Titania asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will the Brownies take us away from here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Florimel shook his head despondently as he answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say that we are all prisoners like yourselves.
See, Titania, I have brought you this. I thought perhaps that
it might help us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the little cooing creature from the bosom of his
jacket and stroked its soft sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Euphrosyne&rsquo;s dove!&rdquo; exclaimed Titania. &ldquo;There is a shaft
above through which it can escape. Let us send it with a
message to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon a scrap of paper she hastily wrote the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<cite>Euphrosyne, Fair Goddess of Mirth:</cite></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dragonfel the wicked enchanter holds us captive in his country. Help
us, we beseech you, before it is too late.</p>

<p><span class="sign">&ldquo;Queen Titania.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
</div>

<p>While she wrote Florimel noticed with some uneasiness that
water was trickling down the walls and that in some places on
the floor pools had already formed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tie the note to the dove&rsquo;s neck,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let us dispatch
it immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did so, and he flung the little creature upward toward
the shaft. Its talons clutched a side precariously while it fluttered
its wings to sustain itself in the frail, uncertain hold it
had.</p>
</div>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i188.png" width="328" height="256" alt="Water comes in" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little
thing!&rdquo; said
Titania, when
she noticed
that it was in
great danger
of falling. &ldquo;It
cannot help
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
cried the excited
Violet.
&ldquo;It is making
for the opening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the relief of all its watchers the bird crept through the
shaft and disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good luck go with it!&rdquo; was Dame Drusilda&rsquo;s fervent ejaculation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Titania, Titania,&rdquo; said Florimel, &ldquo;it may be our happiness
depends upon that bird!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then almost immediately afterward to their utter horror and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
consternation water in immense volumes began to pour down
through the shaft until blinded and drenched as they suddenly
became it seemed to them as if all the flood-gates of the earth
had been opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; shouted Florimel. &ldquo;We must get out of here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He flung open the door, fearing that the Red Spirit was
still outside, but the terrified clamor of voices that rose from
all sides had caused him to desert his post.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i189.png" width="452" height="395" alt="More water" title="" />
</div>

<p>The water which in an incredibly short time had risen nearly
to their waists began racing down the passage, but still it did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
not appear to recede. &ldquo;Let us go at once,&rdquo; urged Florimel,
&ldquo;for if we stay here we shall be lost.&rdquo; He gathered up the
trembling Titania in his arms, and with his burden staggered
through the water toward the door, while Dame Drusilda,
Violet, and Daffodil followed close upon his heels.</p>

<p>Down the passage that had now become a violent raceway
of raging, foaming water they all fled, for Florimel realized
that their only chance of escape, small as it might be, was to
join those who were familiar with the entrances to the mine.</p>

<p>But as they got closer to the main-shaft the confusion and uproar
grew wilder, and with a sickening
feeling he became
aware that those
whose help he
had hoped for
were quite as
powerless as
he. Ear-splitting
shrieks of
horror made
a very pandemonium
of
awful sound,
and over all was
heard the despairing
cry of Grouthead:
&ldquo;The mine is flooded, and
the force-pumps can&rsquo;t save us. We shall all be drowned!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="st">DISASTER TO<br />
DRAGONFEL</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Dragonfel&rsquo;s</span> mine was flooded,
and as the water kept pouring in
from all sides, there was no escape
for the unfortunates who were in
its chambers.</p>

<p>The passage which was mainly
used in a descent to the mine had
become a raging river impossible
to withstand so deep was it and with a current so strong.</p>

<p>The way by which the Brownies had entered the mine was
blocked by the giant boulder which could only be removed by the
pressure of a secret spring from the outside. The boulder had
brought captivity to the band, and now it threatened even direr
results, for those several tons of stone stubbornly barred the
way to safety.</p>

<p>It was evident that the violent disturbances deep down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the earth which had caused the earthquake and volcano were
likewise responsible for the flood.</p>

<p>The water came in streams from the entrances, cracks, and
fissures until the main-shaft was transformed into a lake that
constantly grew deeper, and through this with shrieks and
screams all plunged, fleeing
hither and thither, but
with no definite point in
their dazed minds.</p>

<p>Dragonfel and his followers in particular lost their heads,
and their fear and cowardice were indeed pitiable. All their
bravado had deserted them, and from the blustering bullies they
had been they became sorry, trembling wretches vainly beseeching
help and voicing the terror at their hearts in wild,
unearthly cries.</p>

<p>But, though the Brownies were alarmed like all the rest, they
still retained their presence of mind, and under the cool-headed
direction of King Stanislaus they at once set about to do certain
things, with the hope that a way would afterward be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
found to get them out of all danger, helping hands were
busy.</p>

<p>Prince Florimel assisted Titania, Dame Drusilda, Violet, and
Daffodil to a ledge that was still out of the reach of the advancing
waters, charging them most earnestly to remain there,
after which he ran back, and added his efforts to those of his
companions.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i193.png" width="446" height="230" alt="Rescue" title="" />
</div>

<p>The little mine-sprites were most in need of aid, and to them
the Brownies devoted the work of rescue. They were all in
great peril of drowning, and though it seemed that such a fate
could only be delayed for a time, they started to remove the
poor, frightened creatures to places as far beyond the rapidly
encroaching waters as possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i194.png" width="356" height="499" alt="In the basket" title="" />
</div>

<p>Brownies scaled the walls and lodged themselves in a pocket
up to which they hauled with great effort a number of mine-sprites
in one of the large baskets that were used in loading
the jewels before they were carted away.</p>

<p>Others of the terrified sprites sought refuge by climbing over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the Brownies&rsquo; willing backs to a temporary refuge high among
the rocks.</p>

<p>The Irishman, Scotchman, and German put three in a wheelbarrow,
and started to trundle them off, but to their great dismay
it turned over, and spilled them out. Assistance, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
was quickly rendered, and with the mine-sprites back in the
wheelbarrow they continued on their way.</p>

<p>Still the waters
rose, and the
excitement
increased.</p>

<p>Dragonfel in
the most
abject
terror
stormed and
shouted at
his followers,
issuing angry
commands
for them to exert themselves to do something, but they were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
helpless, and his words were wasted on the air to no purpose.</p>

<p>They were too frightened to be of assistance, even if it had
been possible to render it, though
in cases where one was overcome
there were those who attempted
the work of resuscitation.</p>

<p>The wicked enchanter ran about like a maniac, with little
or no thought of where he was going, until suddenly with
a shriek of fright he plunged into a circular pit that had
been dug deep into the earth for a distance of perhaps fifty
feet.</p>

<p>There was sufficient water at the bottom of the pit to break
his severe fall, which was fortunate for him, as otherwise it
would have resulted in his end.</p>

<p>He was stunned and dazed, but in nowise injured beyond
some bruises, and he frantically reached up and clutched a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
jagged point of rock by which he pulled himself out of the
water that was nearly to his neck and promising him more.</p>

<p>The horror of his situation was at once made plain to him.
Beyond this rock there was nothing by which he could maintain
even the slightest hold, and the waters which were steadily
rising would soon submerge him and end all.</p>

<p>His evil scheming had led to his own undoing, and in causing
misfortune to so many he had brought upon himself the
most terrible misfortune of all.</p>

<p>Looking up helplessly he could see a number of the Brownies
trying to peer down at him through the darkness. They lay
flat on their stomachs, and leaned as far out over the hole as
prudence would permit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; screamed Dragonfel, in a frenzy of fear.
&ldquo;Save me! save me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His piteous cries were heard by all the Brownies, and they
looked at each other in doubt and uncertainty. When the
monster whom they had every reason to fear had met with the
mishap which now made him powerless it was not to be gainsaid
that a feeling of great relief was experienced by one and
all. No matter what harm might come to them from other
sources, certainly his power to injure them was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should we help him?&rdquo; said one of the Brownies. &ldquo;He
has harmed us all he could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he drowns,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;he will never have a chance
to do so again.&rdquo; But King Stanislaus looked very grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter how much he has wronged us,&rdquo; he said decidedly,
&ldquo;he needs our help, so we must give it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is our enemy,&rdquo; objected the Policeman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That makes no difference,&rdquo; said His Majesty. &ldquo;He will
drown if we do not aid him.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If we save him,&rdquo; said Uncle Sam, &ldquo;he will only make trouble
for us again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must not think of that,&rdquo; said King Stanislaus. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
in distress, and doesn&rsquo;t need to advertise it. That&rsquo;s where
the Brownies step in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave his orders, and the Brownies with the realization
that there was not a moment to be lost ran with all possible
speed for the long rope which they had used in hauling up the
mine-sprites in the basket. This they brought to the opening,
tripping and sprawling over it in the eagerness and anxiety they
displayed.</p>

<p>They stood in a line, and lowered the rope down into the pit.</p>
</div>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i197.png" width="228" height="279" alt="Assorted diamonds" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Slip the noose at the end
of the rope under your arms,&rdquo;
shouted King Stanislaus to
Dragonfel, &ldquo;and we will pull
you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The water was nearly over
Dragonfel&rsquo;s head by this
time, and he had ceased his
cries for help, for whenever
he opened his mouth he
choked and strangled. He
heard the welcome words of
the king as in a dream, but
half unconscious as he was he
reached out, and caught the
rope, tightened his grip upon
it. He discovered the slip-noose at the end, and with his senses
fast leaving him had just enough strength left to adjust this
under both his arms. When the Brownies felt the rope grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
taut they began to haul away with might and main. Around
the pit now there were willing minds and itching fingers.
Some fell over with their exertions, but in a trice they were
up again to contribute all the strength they had to the work.
&ldquo;Pull away, boys!&rdquo; shouted King Stanislaus encouragingly,
with his own royal digits wound tightly around the rope. &ldquo;A
long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together! That&rsquo;s the
ticket! Hurray! We&rsquo;ll soon have him up.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i198.png" width="438" height="334" alt="Dragonfel rescued" title="" />
</div>

<p>His words incited them so that through undue effort they
suddenly lost their balance and sprawled over backward like
ten-pins.</p>

<p>Like a shot Dragonfel fell back into the water again, almost
dragging after him a half-dozen Brownies who still clung to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the rope. But others quickly grasped them by the legs, and
prevented them from going over into the pit until a fresh hold
of the rope was secured, and another attempt was made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avast there, messmates!&rdquo; cried the Sailor. &ldquo;Give an old
salt a chance at the fore-clutch on the hawser, and the old pirate
will soon come up from the bottom of the sea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time the Brownies were successful, and they pulled
Dragonfel to the brink, and rolled him over to a place of temporary
safety.</p>

<p>Water poured from his drenched form, and with a groan he
relapsed into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>The Brownies looked first at him, and then at each other.
Though no one said a word, all had the same thought.</p>

<p>Soon Dragonfel would revive, and then what would happen?
They had saved their foe, but to what purpose? If by any
chance they should escape the present
dreadful danger they were in they would
still be in the wicked enchanter&rsquo;s power.</p>

<p>How would he use it?</p>

</div>

<p class="st">AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY<br />
EVER AFTER</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Dragonfel</span> had been rescued
by the Brownies at a crucial
time when perhaps they might
have been justified in trying to
save themselves instead.</p>

<p>The water kept on swiftly
rising, and it forced them out
of the positions they occupied
to ledges and pockets higher
up on the rocks. To these all
were forced to retreat, and the
still senseless enchanter was carried after them by some of his
cowardly, frightened followers who would have left him behind
if it had not been for the stern command of King Stanislaus.</p>

<p>Still higher and higher rose the water till they were again
threatened in their new places of refuge, and it soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
became evident that something had to be done, and that
quickly.</p>

<p>There was but one passage-way through which the water
was not pouring like that of a swift mill-race, and this was the
one in which the Brownies had been trapped.</p>

<p>As the water ascended they were forced into it, and they
continued on through it well knowing from bitter experience
that the huge boulder effectually blocked the exit, and would
hold them powerless until finally they were submerged by the
relentless flood.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i201.png" width="327" height="251" alt="Conversation" title="" />
</div>

<p>But still they
went on, hoping
against
hope, until
they came to
the boulder.
It was still
in place, and
though they
exerted all
their strength
in trying to
remove it they
could not
budge it to
even the extent of a millionth of an inch.</p>

<p>Brownies used sticks as levers, and the demons employed
brute force, but all their efforts proved in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; at last said King Stanislaus, wiping his perspiring
brow. &ldquo;It looks as though this would be the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden thought entered Florimel&rsquo;s head&mdash;a wild, foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
thought perhaps, but not any more so than when he had aimed
his magic arrow at the crescent moon.</p>

<div class="i202">
<div class="block225">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block250">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block275">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="block300">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockall1">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&ldquo;Stand back, all of you!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>He took one of the four arrows that were in the quiver, and
placed it in the bow.
Then he aimed it at the
rock, and pulled
the cord, making no particular attempt at a display of strength
which he realized fully could not accomplish his purpose.</p>

<p>But to the infinite delight and astonishment of all a strange
thing happened, that made the eyes pop in from every head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>The arrow struck the base of the rock, which at the moment
of contact burst into hundreds of jagged pieces that flew up into
the air. As these fell they formed a series of steps that were
as good as any mason could have planned.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i203.png" width="454" height="390" alt="The arrow struck" title="" />
</div>

<p>They ascended these steps with all possible haste up into the
open, where the blue sky was above them, and where they
could breathe freely the air that never before had seemed so
sweet and pure.</p>

<p>Looking around they could note the ravages of the flood, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
with it there had come a mighty tidal wave from the sea, with
abnormally high water that had changed the low marshlands
into lakes, and had swollen the small creeks to roaring, rushing
rivers.</p>
</div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i204.png" width="301" height="313" alt="Whisper to the policeman" title="" />
</div>

<p>Just then a vivacious
little mine-sprite
found an
opportunity to
whisper to the
Policeman:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is leap-year,
officer, and,
to speak freely,
I loved you at
first sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the
Policeman, with
his usual composure,
&ldquo;to speak even
more freely, your
love at second sight
is not returned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would be willing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to fly with you to parts unknown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble,&rdquo; said the Policeman. &ldquo;No parts are
unknown to the Brownies. The world was our oyster, and
we&rsquo;ve opened it. We&rsquo;re just as well known in Timbuctoo as
Tarrytown!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an angry swell that caused Dragonfel&rsquo;s galleon
to toss violently up and down, but it still held secure to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
anchor, and formed a picture inviting to a sailor&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p>The enchanter was laid upon the greensward by those who
bore him, and he stirred uneasily, while his hand sought his
forehead. Then he opened his eyes, and unsteadily tried to
get on his feet, in which effort others sprang to his assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; he asked, as dazed and puzzled he looked
around. &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His gaze took in the Brownies, and, in spite of all they had
just done for him, it was not a reassuring one. But somehow
they feared him no longer, for they felt that no matter what
further villainy he might attempt they were more than a match
for him.</p>

<p>But before some one could answer Dragonfel Euphrosyne,
the Goddess of Mirth, suddenly appeared in their midst, though
no one could tell just how or from whence she came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meddlesome spirit that you are,&rdquo; she said sternly, addressing
her words to the crestfallen enchanter, &ldquo;you can no longer
trouble the Brownies. Your commission to do evil has expired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I made application for a renewal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but, through an error in the date, you were
too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late?&rdquo; he repeated blankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, by thirteen seconds,&rdquo; she announced triumphantly,
&ldquo;and Beelzebub refuses to renew the policy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; ejaculated Dragonfel, with much chagrin.
&ldquo;This comes of trying to run business without an almanac!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henceforth you will be compelled to be good,&rdquo; said Euphrosyne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dragonfel, in a rather shamefaced manner. &ldquo;It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
may come rather hard at first, but I suppose I will get used to
it in time. As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m growing rather tired of
being bad. There&rsquo;s nothing to it, after all. The only thing
one gets from being bad is a lack of respect in the community.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i205.png" width="439" height="299" alt="Somewhat repentant" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re somewhat repentant,&rdquo; said Euphrosyne encouragingly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little late, of course, but still it&rsquo;s better late
than never. You understand, don&rsquo;t you, that after this you&rsquo;re
to let the Brownies alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say I will let them alone,&rdquo; coincided Dragonfel
heartily. &ldquo;The Brownies are too much for me. They have
beaten me at every point. Even if I were disposed to do them
further mischief I am placed in a rather delicate situation. I
owe my life to the Brownies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing on which I insist,&rdquo; spoke up King Stanislaus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
&ldquo;You must do something for these poor mine-sprites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see that they are restored to their parents from whom
they were stolen,&rdquo; asserted Dragonfel hastily. &ldquo;Furthermore
they shall all be given handsome dowries, with a beautiful solitaire
diamond of a half-dozen karats more or less for each, so
that when the right young man comes along the engagement-ring
will be easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the mine-sprite who had expressed her preference for
the Policeman gave him a coy glance, but he twirled his club,
and looked the other way.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i206.png" width="228" height="238" alt="Dragonfel eating" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad about your
palace,&rdquo; said the Dude to
Dragonfel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t trouble yourself
about that,&rdquo; said the enchanter
cheerfully. &ldquo;I never
did like its style of architecture,
anyhow.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll soon have it rebuilt,
and give the Union scale
for labor, with double pay
for over-time. The palace
was a rather tame affair
anyway, I ran too much to
the emerald, topaz, and turquoise in its composition. I&rsquo;ll make
more use of the sapphire, the ruby and cornelian, in the makeup
of the new structure; and those columns, I always felt a
little weak over them, as they were only imitation chalcedony,
the real thing goes in the next one, if I have to import it from
Palestine.&rdquo; The glances the Brownies exchanged showed they
felt that they had struck a master in his line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said, that some of the Brownies, to this day, annually
celebrate their deliverance from the mine, and the reformation
of Dragonfel, by proudly parading half the night, bearing the
implements they had to use while in captivity.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i207.png" width="329" height="190" alt="Parading" title="" />
</div>

<p>So delighted was King Stanislaus over the general outcome
that his blithe spirits found expression in a jolly song that
was a great favorite of his, and the Brownies all joined in the
chorus. The words follow:</p>

<p>The refrain was so rollicking and infectious that when it
was repeated Dragonfel and his followers could not keep from
joining in with the Brownies, and they lustily roared out the
words with a right good will.</p>

<p>The delayed wedding of Prince Florimel and Queen Titania
was celebrated very soon after in the fairy-palace with all the
joy and happiness that can come to such a momentous occasion.</p>

<p>Brownies and fairies vied with each other in having a good
time, and the walls rang with their innocent merry-making.
Everyone said that King Stanislaus was the life of the party.</p>

<p>Dragonfel and his followers participated in the festivities,
this time unfeared, and to the strains of a Brownie orchestra
they mingled with others in the dance. Dragonfel even tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to do the fox-trot with Dame Drusilda, which greatly delighted
Euphrosyne who was among those present.</p>

<p>In place of the useless, cumbersome presents he had first
brought the enchanter gave the bride the more appropriate and
useful gift of a dozen bushels of precious stones.</p>

<p>So in this wonderful country King Florimel and his beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
queen are still living and
ruling wisely, and, to make
their happiness complete,
there are little children round
them.</p>

<p>To these King Florimel will
leave the heritage of the
magic bow and arrows, for
life has glided smoothly on,
and the time has never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
so grave or distressing, as to necessitate their use. But should
that time ever come the king has full confidence in his ex-fairy
godmother&rsquo;s gift.</p>

<p>To the palace the Brownies come frequently, and it is needless
to say that they are welcome, just as they are welcome everywhere.</p>

<p>But they cannot be there as often as King Florimel would like
them to be because their kindly spirit takes them over the whole
world to promote peace, good humor, and good will to all
human kind.</p>
